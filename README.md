## Project Ideas

### Kubernetes

TODO

### Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit: https://prometheus.io/

#### Add option to log slow queries and recording rules
* Description: Having something like PostgreSQL's log_min_duration_statement would be useful to debug performance problems. It would be great to collect detailed query information, like how many chunks were necessary to compute the result and how many had to be loaded from disk.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Ben Kochie (@SuperQ)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1315

### Envoy

TODO

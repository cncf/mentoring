## Project Ideas

### Kubernetes

Please visit the [Kubernetes GSoC page](https://git.k8s.io/community/mentoring/google-summer-of-code.md) for general information.

#### OpenAPI spec references in CustomResourceDefinitions
* Description: CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) often reuse Kubernetes types and embed them, e.g. a PodSpec. Today a CRD has to copy the whole OpenAPI spec for that type. For types like PodSpec these can be huge. The idea here is to define a Kubernetes OpenAPI universe which allows to point from a CRD to the spec of other types in the universe, e.g. the mentioned PodSpec.
This project includes conceptual work of defining such a universe with the current, published OpenAPI spec in mind, to come up with a design for how and when to resolve the new references, to write a proposal for all that and of course to code the feature within the apiextensions-apiserver.
* Recommended Skills: Golang, OpenAPI
* Mentor(s): Dr. Stefan Schimanski (@sttts), Mehdy Bohlool (@mbohlool)
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/54579

#### Client-go semantic versioning
* Description: The client-go library is vendored by many 3rdparty projects. We version it with semantic version numbers like 5.0.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 6.0.0. On each release we increase the major version. We don't have any tooling in place that warns about incompatible changes when changes are merged into the Kubernetes code-base.
This project is about changing this by developing and applying a tool to each Kubernetes code change that looks at the changed Go code and whether it breaks any Golang interfaces. This also involves the definition which parts of client-go and other libraries are actual interfaces we promise to preserve. Finally, this project includes the integration into our test infrastructure.
* Recommended Skills: Golang, Go parser, Go language specification and semantics, CI
* Mentor(s): Dr. Stefan Schimanski (@sttts), Chao Xu (@caesarxuchao)

#### Batch scheduling and queueing for data processing/ML workloads
* Description: Investigate kube-arbitrator, adapt one well known application running on Kubernetes (Apache Spark/Tensorflow/others) to use batch scheduling and queueing functionality, do performance benchmarking, and then produce a document detailing the approach and recommendations.
* Recommended Skill(s): Golang
* Mentor(s): Klaus Ma (@k82cn), Anirudh Ramanathan (@foxish), @ynli
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/269

#### Strategic Merge Patch support for CustomResourceDefinitions
* Description: Strategic Merge Patches are a data format of the HTTP Patch operation against Kubernetes objects. They allow to control how maps and slices are modified, either via tags in the patches or via tags on the Go types. CustomResources are no native Go types in Kubernetes which breaks Strategic Merge Patch. This topic is about adding Strategic Merge Patch support for `runtime.Unstructured` and to create an API to define the default merge strategies for JSON paths within CustomResources.
* Recommended Skill(s): Golang, Algorithms
* Mentors(s): Dr. Stefan Schimanski (@sttts)
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56348 and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58064

#### OpenTracing support
* Description: In order to troubleshoot Kubernetes latencies it would be great to have tracing support. Metrics are great for alerting, to know if something is wrong, but by design are not meant to trace the execution of single requests. Tracing support would allow troubleshooting high latency requests in order to find performance improvement opportunities more easily and quickly.
This project involves evaluating tracing solutions as well as implementing support for the Kubernetes API handlers.
* Recommended skills: Kubernetes, OpenTracing
* Mentor(s): Dr. Stefan Schimanski (@sttts), Frederic Branczyk (@brancz)
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/26507

### Containerd

#### KataContainers support for containerd/cri-containerd 
* Description: [cri-containerd](https://github.com/containerd/cri-containerd) is a Kubernetes CRI implementation for [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd), the core part of Docker. [KataContainers](https://katacontainers.io) is a OCI container runtime which leverages hypervisor-based isolation for Linux container stack. This topic aims at integrating KataContainers as a underlying runtime of containerd and serve Kubernetes CRI. In which case, users of Kubernetes will be able to enjoy security and multi-tenancy brought by KataConainers as well as native Linux container experience brought by containerd.
* Recommended Skill(s): Golang, Linux Operating System
* Mentors(s): Harry Zhang (@resouer), Lantao Liu (@Random-Liu),  Jiangshan Lai (@laijs)


### Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit: https://prometheus.io/

Prometheus ideas:

#### Streaming APIs
* Description: Currently the HTTP API sends all the data in one go and that has the chance overwhelm prometheus. To guard against this, there are limits set in Prometheus. Make APIs streaming where data is retrieved and sent in chunks rather than at once.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz), Goutham V (@gouthamve)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3690

#### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead
* Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit. 
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3416

#### Unify the testing across all packages.
* Description: Currently we have tests using just the standard library so there is a lot of code repetition. We want to unify the tests and make the code 'dry'. 
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Goutham V (@gouthamve), Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3242


#### Add option to log slow queries
* Description: Having something like PostgreSQL's log_min_duration_statement would be useful to debug performance problems. It would be great to collect detailed query information, like how many chunks were necessary to compute the result and how many had to be loaded from disk. Further having detailed stats like the number of series/samples/blocks touched would be great.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Ben Kochie (@SuperQ), Goutham V (@gouthamve)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1315

#### Building a full integration testing environment and benchmarks
* Description: We're not really excellent in the correctness / bug-free-ness department yet, partially because certain key components either lack tests or you'd have to run them in a real-world scenario for a while to discover certain bugs. I'm especially looking at our under-tested service discovery mechanisms here that require e.g. a Zookeeper or Consul as a dependency to test them for real. It'd be cool to have a test environment that runs a Prometheus release end-to-end (with different SD mechanisms) for a while and checks the results (evaluated expressions, alerts, etc.) for sanity.
* Recommended Skills: golang, infrastructure management
* Mentor(s): Brian Brazil (@brian-brazil), Conor Broderick (@Conorbro)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3689

#### Features that aid in building and testing alerting expressions
* Description: One of the most annoying (but important) things when using Prometheus is making sure that your alerting expressions are correct (semantically, syntactically, and referring to existing template variables). It would be great to be able to assist the user with that. This would be both frontend and backend / tooling work.
* Recommended Skills: golang, javascript
* Mentor(s): Julius Volz (@juliusv)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1154 https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1695 https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1220 https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1219

#### Tracing in Prometheus and Alertmanager
* Description: We can use open-tracing to trace several things in both prometheus and alertmanager, for example, prometheus query tracing.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz), Tom Wilkie (@tomwilkie)

#### Persist “for” state for alerts
* Description: Currently if Prometheus restarts, we lose the 'for' state for firing alerts. While this isn't an issue for short for clauses, it presents a problem for clauses that are in the hours to days range. It'd be good to persist this state in some way, so that alerts don't have to start again from scratch. We probably don't want to count the time the prometheus server is down against the 'for' clause.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Goutham V (@gouthamve), Brian Brazil (@brian-brazil)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/422

Alertmanager ideas:

#### Replace weaveworks/mesh
* Description: It's effectively unmaintained, and we have various known problems; initial investigation shows hashicorp/memberlist might be a good candidate, as it has many similar primitives in its library.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/1200

#### Optimize Alert Ingest Path
* Description: While benchmarking & profiling Alertmanager it quickly became obvious, that the ingest path blocks _a lot_ and can be optimised.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/1201

#### Improve Alert Indexing
* Description: Currently there are various maps to improve access to certain alerts, but very scattered across the code base and seemingly unrelated. We can have a lot of improvement if we move to something similar to the TSDB reverse index.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/1202

TSDB ideas:

#### Isolation
* Description: Currently the writes and reads are not isolated and sometimes during reads we see partial write data.
* Recommended Skills: golang, databases
* Mentor(s): Fabian Reinartz (@fabxc), Brian Brazil (@brian-brazil), Goutham V (@gouthamve)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/issues/260

#### Label Values Composite Index
* Description: We can have faster queries and new APIs if we can have a composite index for multiple index names rather than just one.
* Recommended Skills: golang, databases
* Mentor(s): Goutham V (@gouthamve), Fabian Reinartz (@fabxc)
* Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/issues/26

Kubernetes + Prometheus ideas:

#### Kubernetes Pod Exporter
* Description: A cAdvisor replacement to collect container metrics. Would be dependant on the cri-o metrics endpoint.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz)

#### Prometheus Metrics Server
* Description: Prometheus backed implementation of the resource metrics API in Kubernetes.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz)

Misc. ideas:

#### Prometheus Outalator
* Description: A full-fledged outlator fully integrated with the Alertmanager. https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/tracking-outages.html
* Recommended Skills: golang, javascript
* Mentor(s): Frederic Branczyk (@brancz), Brian Brazil (@brian-brazil), Richard Hartmann (@RichiH)

### Envoy

#### Replace evbuffer buffer implementation with custom rewrite
* Description: Currently Envoy uses a buffer implementation based on libevent evbuffer. This
  implementation has a number of shortcomings. We would like to do a custom C++14 rewrite.
* Required skills: C/C++
* Mentor(s): Lyft networking team

#### Add more fuzzing
* Description: Envoy is only now getting fuzz testing support. By this summer the coverage will
  be limited. We would love someone to come and increase the fuzz coverage.
* Required skills: C/C++
* Mentor(s): Lyft networking team and consulting with Google Envoy team.

### CoreDNS

CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins <https://coredns.io>.

#### DNSSEC

* Develop/extend the DNSSEC plugin be able to exchange key material with the registrar - in essence
  implementing zero-touch DNSSEC.
* Required skills: DNSSEC, cryptography, Go
* Mentors: [Miek Gieben](https://github.com/miekg).

#### etcd3 Support

* Develop a plugin that supports [etcd3 API](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/v2/api_v3.html) See also https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/341
* Required skills: Go
* Mentors: [John Belamaric](https://github.com/johnbelamaric)

#### Autoscaling Secondary DNS in Kubernetes

* This is more complicated than it sounds. When a primary zone changes, the secondary servers are notified.
If CoreDNS is running as a set of autoscaling Pods in Kubernetes, only one of the CoreDNS instances will
receive the NOTIFY message through the load balancer. It is necessary for that CoreDNS Pod to understand
how to relay that message to other CoreDNS Pods. This should be done without a direct reliance on the Kubernetes
API as it can be useful in non-Kubernetes deployments as well, so it is necessary to define a mechanism whereby
CoreDNS instances may discovery one another.
* Required skills: Go
* Mentors: [John Belamaric](https://github.com/johnbelamaric)

#### Conditional Name Server Identifier

* Description: Currently CoreDNS supports DNS Name Server Identifier (NSID) to allow a DNS server to self-identify itself. In a distributed system collision may occur, so a mechanism is needed to allow a server to conditionally declare its identity. There a several ways to achieve this goal. One way is to ask a name server to wait until its precedence already declares (e.g., `server-1`), before assigning a non-conflict identity to itself (e.g., `server-2`). Another way is to extract the identity from another source, e.g., the timestamp of the server on the cloud, or a lock from K-V store like zookeeper or etcd.
* Recommended Skills: Golang

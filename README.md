#### Integrate kube-batch with pytorch-operator/mxnet-operator

-	Description: [kube-batch](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-batch) is a batch scheduler for kubernetes by features for batch workload, e.g. coscheduling/gang-scheduling, faire-sharing; the train job of MxNet and Pytorch have requirements to those features. This idea is to integrate kube-batch to support gang-scheduling/coscheduling and other batch features in related operators.
-	Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, kubeflow
-	Mentor(s): Klaus Ma (@k82cn)
-	Issue: https://github.com/kubeflow/mxnet-operator/issues/16 , https://github.com/kubeflow/pytorch-operator/issues/129

#### Implement volume snapshotting support into the external Manila provisioner

- Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/12503

#### Add support for Custom Resource Definitions to the Dashboard

- Description: Kubernetes Dashboard has no support for Custom Resource Definitions yet. The goal is to provide support for them as it was done for Third Party Resources in the past. Users should be able to perform at least the basic operations on the resources they have defined.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Golang, TypeScript, Angular
- Mentor(s): Marcin Maciaszczyk (@maciaszczykm), Sebastian Florek (@floreks)
- Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/2493

- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Golang, TypeScript, Angular
- Mentor(s): Marcin Maciaszczyk (@maciaszczykm), Sebastian Florek (@floreks)
- Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/1832

### Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit: https://prometheus.io/

Prometheus ideas:

#### Benchmarks for TSDB

-	Description: The TSDB module used in Prometheus doesn’t have proper benchmarks yet, which means we cannot see the potential impact of the changes we are introducing. The idea is to build some automated benchmarking which can be added to the CI pipeline.
-	Recommended Skills: CI, Golang, Kubernetes
-	Mentor(s): Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
-	Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/issues/235

#### Continue the work on Prombench

-	Description: Since we finished Prombench there have been few requests to add scalability tests, add more tests with the race enabled and there are few pending issues to be fixed.
-	Recommended Skills: CI, Golang, Kubernetes, Grafana
-	Mentor(s): Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
-	Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prombench/issues - the High priority ones should be addressed first.

### Open Policy Agent (OPA)

OPA is a domain-agnostic policy engine that embodies "policy as code": https://www.openpolicyagent.org/

#### IntelliJ plugin to experiment with and visualize policy evaluation

-   Description: OPA features a high-level declarative language that lets you express policies like "user X can perform operation Y on resource Z" or "all images deployed in Kubernetes must come from an internal registry and be scanned for vulnerabilities". The language supports many features: unit testing, dry running, tracing, etc. While users can access these features via the command-line, IDE integrations greatly improve the policy authoring experience. The idea is to port functionality that we have inside of [VS Code](https://github.com/tsandall/vscode-opa) to IntelliJ. This would significantly improve the authoring experience for people that use IntelliJ on a day-to-day basis.
-   Recommended Skills: Java, IntelliJ (not required, but nice to have)
-   Mentor(s): Torin Sandall (@tsandall)
-   Issue: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1085

#### Interactive website detailing OPA integrations
- Description: OPA has been integrated with 20+ cloud-native systems to provide rich, context-aware policy support, e.g. Kubernetes, Istio, Envoy, Linkerd, Terraform, Ceph, Minio.  Today there is no authoritative guide for users to understand what those integrations are, how they work, or how to get started.  This project involves designing and implementing an interactive web portal that helps users understand the integrations available with OPA.  It will be data-driven, so that new integrations can easily be added to the portal, and each entry will include code-snippets, videos, blog posts, github-repos, tutorials, reviews, and overall status.
- Recommended Skills: Frontend HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Backend Node/Python/Go/etc.
- Mentor(s): Tim Hinrichs (@timothyhinrichs) and Torin Sandall (@tsandall)
- Issue: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1194

#### Integration with IPTables
- Description: One common use of policy is to set up IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.  The policy dictates what to do with different kinds of packets.  There have been several requests in the past to use OPA policies to control IPTables, but no one has come forth with an integration.  This project involves designing the layout of IPTable rules using OPA's policy language, implementing the algorithms that generate IPTables from that layout, and writing the code that populates the generated IPTables rules into Linux.
- Recommended Skills: Go and Linux
- Mentor(s): Tim Hinrichs (@timothyhinrichs) and Torin Sandall (@tsandall)
- Issue: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1195

### CoreDNS

CoreDNS is a fast and flexible DNS server. It has a focus of service discovery in a hybrid environment and is the default DNS server in Kubernetes (since 1.13+): https://github.com/coredns/coredns

#### Support source-IP based query block/allow

-	Description: When CoreDNS serves DNS queries publicly or inside Kubernetes clusters, the source IP of the incoming DNS query is an important identity. For security considerations, only certain queries (from specific source-IP or CIDR block) should be allowed to prevent the server from being attacked. The goal of this project is to support a firewall-like source-IP based block/allow mechanism for CoreDNS.
-	Recommended Skills: Golang
-	Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang)

#### Support Google Cloud DNS backend

-	Description: CoreDNS is able to serve DNS with cloud vendors (such as AWS) as the backend. The feature is very much useful in a hybrid environment where cloud-vendor specific service endpoints need to be exposed to clusters managed by Kubernetes. The goal of this project is to support Google Cloud DNS (similar to already supported [route53 plugin](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/tree/master/plugin/route53)) as a backend for CoreDNS.
-	Recommended Skills: Golang, Google Cloud
-	Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang)

#### Support Azure DNS backend

-	Description: CoreDNS is able to serve DNS with cloud vendors (such as AWS) as the backend. The feature is very much useful in a hybrid environment where cloud-vendor specific service endpoints need to be exposed to clusters managed by Kubernetes. The goal of this project is to support Azure DNS (similar to already supported [route53 plugin](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/tree/master/plugin/route53)) as a backend for CoreDNS.
-	Recommended Skills: Golang, Microsoft Azure
-	Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang)

### TiKV

TiKV is an open-source distributed transactional Key-Value database. [https://tikv.org](https://tikv.org).

#### Migrate to tower-grpc

- Description: We use grpc-rs which wraps C gRPC, and we want to work better with Rust community and use a pure Rust gRPC. The goal for this section is to use tower-grpc to replace our current grpc-rs.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, gRPC
- Mentor(s): JianJun Li (@busyjay), Nick Cameron (@nrc)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/3951

#### Introduce other storage engines

- Description: TiKV uses RocksDB as its storage engine, but RocksDB is not suitable for all workloads. The goal for this section is to use other storage engines to satisfy different workloads.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, RocksDB
- Mentor(s): Nick Cameron (@nrc), Yi Wu (@yiwu-arbug)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/4184


#### Build TiKV clients in different languages

- Description: TiKV now only contains an official Go client, we need more. The goal for this section is to build TiKV client with other languages like C++, Java, Rust, etc.
- Recommended Skills: C++/Java/Rust, gRPC
- Mentor(s): Ana Hobden (@hoverbear), JianJun Li (@busyjay)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/4185

#### Auto-tune RocksDB

- Description: TiKV heavily depends on RocksDB, but RocksDB has many configurations and it is hard to choose proper values in production. The goal for this section is to auto-tune RocksDB in real time for different workloads.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, RocksDB
- Mentor(s): Yi Wu (@yiwu-arbug)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/4052

### Linkerd and Envoy

Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond: https://linkerd.io.
Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications: https://www.envoyproxy.io.

#### Benchmarks for Linkerd and Envoy

- Description: Linkerd, like other service meshes are plagued by the question of adopters asking the question: "what's the performance overhead of the service mesh?". Envoy does not publish performance test results [see How fast is Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/faq/how_fast_is_envoy)). Linkerd, Istio, Envoy and the list of other service meshes don't have a consistent set of performance benchmarks between them. So, even if Envoy were to publish performance results, users still wouldn't be able to compare overhead between Linkerd and Envoy. The project idea here is to build a multi-mesh performance benchmark tool.

- Recommended Skills: Golang, JavaScript, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@leecalcote)
- Issue: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/5536 and https://discourse.linkerd.io/t/linkerd-performance/146

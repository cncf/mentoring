## Ideas

### Kubebuilder

#### Helper to upgrade the projects
- Description: Things change, and we constantly grow the [KubeBuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder), providing new features and bug fixes. Also, sometimes it is required to address incompatible changes via new plugin versions. However, all changes and growth bring some complexities to its users keeping their solutions upgraded and adopting all that is new. The primary motivation of this project is to provide a helper via a command CLI that will automate a common and manual part of this process and try to make it less painful. Also, this project will add a lot of value for Kubebuilder, and its maintainers since it can encourage their users to move forward more frequently. We might be able to use this feature to create lovely automation using git and provide GitHub actions in the future. Note that we have a design proposal to develop the initial version of this feature, which is expected in this project. However, your ideas and input to solve this challenge will be very welcome!
- Expected outcome:
  - Develop a helper to achieve the goal, making it easier for users to upgrade their projects.
  - Interact with the community: make sure the roadmap is generally expected, and continuously receive feedback to move forward with the project.
  - Make the helpers covered adequately with tests and documentation
  - Demonstrate the feature in the community meeting
- Recommended Skills: Go

### Armada

#### Add Kubectl Plugin for Armada

- Description: Armada is a multi-cluster batch scheduling platform for running high-throughput jobs.  Armada provides a CLI for interacting with jobs, queues and watching events. A common way that Kubernetes users interact with Kubernetes is via kubectl.  This project is to build a kubectl plugin that allows users to submit jobs to Armada using kubectl.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Publish a [Krew Plugin](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) for Armada
  - Users can submit jobs, create queues, watch jobs etc using kubectl.
- Recommend Skills: Go, Kubernetes, Kubectl
- Mentor(s): Kevin Hannon, @kannon92, kannon1992@gmail.com
- Expected project size: 175 Hours
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/issues/2120

#### Build interfaces around Postgres for Armada

- Description: Open source projects should not be hard coded to a particular Database. Armada currently only allows users to use Postgres.  This project is to build interfaces around our connections to Postgres so we can allow other databases.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A interface is created that allows Armada to interact with any SQL database without exposing implementation details of postgres
  - With an interface, mocking and testing becomes much easier as you can implement mocks for the DB access.  Currently we require a postgres DB for unit testing.
  - Test coverage could increase
- Recommend Skills: Go, SQL

### Jaeger

#### Implement ClickHouse support

- Description: Jaeger (https://jaegertracing.io) is a popular platform for distributed tracing. ClickHouse is a powerful columnar database, utilized in many commercial and some open source monitoring products. Jaeger currently has a community-provided (unofficial) plugin that implements Jaeger storage backend on top of ClickHouse. This project is to build first-class support for ClickHouse in Jaeger as a core functionality.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Design table schema, document trade-offs
  - Implement ClickHouse support as core storage backend
  - Address schema creation problem / tooling
  - Add relevant documentation to the Jaeger website
- Stretch goals:
  - Use Kafka Connector for ClickHouse for bulk inserts
  - Support Monitoring tab in Jaeger directly from ClickHouse
- Recommended Skills: Go, SQL
- Mentor(s): Yuri Shkuro, @yurishkuro
- Expected project size: 350 Hours
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4196

### Knative

#### Multiple Knative Eventing control planes

- Description: We see more users asking for complete isolation in Knative Eventing deployments. While there are Knative Eventing components that support isolated data planes, we are interested in to see isolated control planes as well. There were discussions about this in the community before and many of the asks were left unadressed. However, we have tools that support multitenancy today, such as [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp). We see this project as an experiment.
- Expected outcome: Finding issues blocking multiple control planes, and possibly fixing them.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Knative, Kubernetes Controllers
- Mentor(s):  Ali Ok @aliok (aliok AT redhat DOT com), Christoph St√§bler @creydr (cstaebler AT redhat DOT com)
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Hard
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/6601

#### Eventing Sender Identity

- Description: Leveraging Kubernetes Service Account identity and OAuth audiences, users should be able to configure Knative Eventing components to authenticate CloudEvent deliveries using the identity of the Subscription, Trigger, or Source. Additionally, Brokers and Channels can leverage the OAuth identity associated with incoming CloudEvents to implement policy.
- Expected outcome: At least the following components are able to use service accounts for authentication: in-memory-channel, multitenant broker, apiserver source, ping source. Ideally, the primitives from this project could be re-used by other channel and broker implementations.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, OAuth or OIDC
- Mentor(s): Evan Anderson @evankanderson
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/5047

#### NetworkPolicy support for Knative Serving

- Description: Implement port-level network routing for Knative Serving internal addresses. This will be an extension of https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/pull/852 to other Knative Ingress implementations, along with implementation of default NetworkPolicies for the activator and Knative Revisions to enforce that requests are routed through the Knative Ingress.
- Expected outcome: Users will be able to use NetworkPolicy to restrict access to their Knative Services at a network (L4 / TCP) level.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes networking, Envoy or protocol familiarity with HTTP
- Mentor(s): Evan Anderson @evankanderson
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Hard
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/6520

#### Improving Observability in Knative Eventing

- Description: We see users struggling to observe what happens inside Knative Eventing and we want that to be improved by providing easy to use tools. The idea is divided into stages. First stage is to write code (python and/or golang) that implements a plugin for Knative command-line interface (kn CLI). The plugin takes output from observability data gathered by Knative and answers simple questions such as: where did my event go based on event id? Show clusters/groups of common traces and show exceptions? The plugin should be able to verify that necessary Knative configuration for observability is enabled, access server side components. Possible next stages may be to create active probes that add to CLI capability to send probe events to specific Knative components (such as Kafka source or broker) and report if they work as expected (health checks). Another area to explore is using conversational AI to improve the plugin by using AI to parse natural language input and/or process available observability data for common Knative questions. As part of the work there may be proposed fixes and improvements for identified gaps in Knative observability that may be discovered when testing the plugin.
- Expected outcome: Improved Knative Eventing observability, improved documentation and published one or more blog posts
- Recommended Skills: Python, data science skills, Golang, Kubernetes

#### Dataplane migration for Apache Kafka communications: From Vert.x to Project Loom

- Description: The Knative Broker's data-plane communication with Apache Kafka for consuming and producing records is currently done via the Vertx Kafka client [library](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-kafka-client). The library is basically a wrapper for communications with Apache Kafka inside of the Vertx threading model. This project requires an evaluation the OpenJDK 19 ["Project Loom"](https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/loom) itself and how to leverage it for efficient communications with an Apache Kafka cluster. The goal of the project is to migrate the usage of Vertx for any communications with Apache Kafka to pure OpenJDK 19's Loom, and reduce the number of 3rd party frameworks, such as vertx for Apache Kafka communication.
- Expected outcome: OpenJDK 19 gets evaluated for our use case, Knative Kafka Broker gets migrated to use Loom for Apache Kafka communication.
- Recommended Skills: Java, Apache Kafka, understanding of Kubernetes

#### Porting Knative Serving to Microshift

- Description: More and more workload is moving towards running on the edge. We saw experiments running Kubernetes on vehicles, fighter jets, 5G antenna and various far edge, near edge and fat edge environments. We would like to see what the challenges are when Knative is run in a resource limited environment. While there are multiple edge-friendly Kubernetes distributions, we would like to see [Microshift](https://github.com/openshift/microshift) used as the base platform. Knative consists of Serving and Eventing modules but focusing on Knative Serving as a first step should be more approachable. The project consists of 2 stages. First one is to run Knative on Microshift with minimal resources. This requires finding out problems here, solving them. A stretch goal is to find out what happens with architectures other than x86_64.
- Expected outcome:  Having Knative Serving with an ingress layer running on top of Microshift. Having a Hello-World Knative Service running on top. Finding issues blocking the edge setup, and possibly fixing them.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Knative, good understanding of networking, good understanding of CI/CD

- Difficulty: Hard
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/12718

#### Self-Balancing Knative Kafka Broker partitions

- Description: Creating a Knative Kafka Broker requires developers to specify the number of partitions the backing Kafka topic should have, however, this is not an easy decision to make and it requires planning based on the expected load the Knative Broker could receive. This project aims to remove this configuration setting by having an autoscaler that is responsible to add or remove partitions based on the effective load the Knative Kafka Broker receives while preserving [ordered and unordered delivery features](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/brokers/broker-types/kafka-broker/#configuring-the-order-of-delivered-events) for Triggers.
- Expected outcome: A Knative Kafka Broker can be created without setting the number of partitions and the number of partitions for a topic backing the Knative Kafka Broker increases or decreases based on the observed load received.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Go, Java

### KubeVela

#### Vela IDE Plugins

- Description: With more and more developers start writing KubeVela (OAM) application YAML file and CUE-based X-Definitions, it is increasingly important to provide some tools to help user make correct configurations. IDE plugin is one way to reach that. We can make VSCode/Jetbrains plugins for formatting and previewing the written applications and KubeVela's X-Definitions. The plugin should be able to sync environment data (including installed X-Definitions) and make dryrun preview for the rendering result of applications intelligently. It can also provide preview capability for the selected clusters when topology policy is written. Live-diff for the current application and remote application configuration is useful as well. In addition to the application, when users write X-Defintinitions based on CUELang, auto validating and previewing for rendering results under mock inputs can also support them.
- Expected outcome: IDE Plugins for KubeVela, or standalone desktop apps
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, NodeJS, KubeVela, CUELang
- Mentor(s): Da Yin @Somefive
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Hard

#### Auto-generate the TypeScript and Java languages API SDK

- Description: Some developers have started to integrate KubeVela into the enterprise system. It is getting increasingly important to provide an API SDK to help developers start faster. Java and TypeScript are currently the two most in-demand languages. KubeVela API server follows the Open API schema. It means the Open API generator tools could provide some help.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Commit the high-quality SDK code, include the TypeScript and Java languages.
  - Commit the GitHub action config and tools to auto-generate SDK.
- Recommended Skills: Java, TypeScript, NodeJS, KubeVela, GithubAction
- Mentor(s): QingGuo Zeng @barnettZQG (barnett.zqg AT gmail.com)
- Expected project size: 175h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issues (URL): https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5428

#### Expand multiple database drivers for the API server

- Description: The API server of the KubeVela needs to save the metadata data to the database to obtain more efficient query efficiency and larger storage space. Now we only support MongoDB. Some users don't have the MongoDB infrastructure. Mysql and PostgreSQL drivers are needed by many users. Most users install the KubeVela without the database. When they want to use it for production, the existing data need to migrate to one database. The migration tool is important.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Commit the Mysql driver code.
  - Commit the PostgreSQL driver code.
  - Commit the migrate data tool code.
- Recommended Skills: Go, KubeVela, Mysql, PostgreSQL

#### KubeVela HA Enhancement-Cluster Meta Backup&Restore

- Description: KubeVela can be deployed in a single management cluster.The KubeVela management cluster has a single point of risk. When KubeVela management clusterdisaster occurs, business continuity cannot be guaranteed. In the production environment of enterprise use case(financial industry), KubeVela needs to have higher availability requirements.  Consider these three enhancements to achieve this goal: cluster meta backup & recovery, master redundancy, failover support. Cluster meta backup & recovery is baseline feature for velaha.
- Expected outcomes:
  - implement velero as KubeVela addon to install velero in kubevela cluster.
  - implement `cli> vela ha enable` to enable cluster meta backup with config scheduled(cron).
  - implement `cli> vela ha restore` to restore cluster meta.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, KubeVela, CUELang

### Strimzi

#### Proof of Concept of an MQTT to Apache Kafka bridge for producing messages

- Description: A really common use case we have been seeing is about enabling an IoT scenario with MQTT based devices and using an Apache Kafka cluster as the events and storage platform running on Kubernetes via Strimzi. In order to do that, there is the need to map the MQTT protocol to the custom Apache Kafka one and bridge from one to the other. This project idea is about designing such a mapping and developing a pure [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/4.1/codec-mqtt/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/mqtt) based MQTT server component (not a full MQTT broker) able to accept MQTT client connections and handling the corresponding communication based on the [MQTT 3.1.1 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html). Finally, developing the Kafka producer part to get messages from MQTT clients and sending them to an Apache Kafka cluster.
- Expected outcome: POC source code for an MQTT to Apache Kafka bridge
- Recommended Skills: Java, MQTT protocol (not mandatory but to be learned)

### WasmEdge

#### Serialization Completion

- Description: WasmEdge is a WebAssembly runtime in both interpreter and ahead-of-time mode. However, WasmEdge only supports the binary format for the input WebAssembly file. To help the text format WebAssembly loader feature in the future, the implementation of serializing a WebAssembly module is necessary. In this mentorship, we hope the mentee should complete the serialization functions already in [the `dev/serialize` branch](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/dev/serialize) of the `WasmEdge` repo.
- Expected outcome: Complete the serialization functions of WebAssembly modules, such as the element segment and data segment encoding. Complete the WebAssembly instructions encoding. Generate the unit test data and pass the unit tests. >80% of code coverage for serialization.
- Recommended Skills: C/C++, WebAssembly
- Mentors: Yi-Ying He @q82419 (yiying at secondstate dot io), Hung-Ying Tai @hydai (hydai at secondstate dot io)
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2262

#### `zlib` Plugin Support

- Description: The zlib is required for compiling and running many existing C / C++ / Rust apps in Wasm. Most noticeably, it is [needed in the Python port to Wasm](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93819). The VMWare Wasm Labs team is using a zlib port from [Singlestore](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/python-wasi) in [their Python Wasm runtime](https://wasmlabs.dev/articles/python-wasm32-wasi/). In WasmEdge, we could support the zlib host functions through our [plugin system](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/plugin.html). This way, any existing zlib apps can be compiled to Wasm and runs inside WasmEdge.
- Expected outcome: Create a new [WasmEdge plugin](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/plugin.html) that exports all public functions in `zlib`. Implement SDK (in C/Rust) that uses the C ABI to generate corresponding headers for the above plugin. Generate the unit tests and pass the unit tests. >80% of code coverage for verification.
- Recommended Skills: C/C++, Rust, WebAssembly

### Keptn

#### Keptn Plugin for Backstage

- Description: Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. As the website states, "powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly ‚Äî without compromising autonomy". It would be nice to provide Keptn integration for this portal so that Keptn can connect as many as other tools. See all Backstage Plugins.  A Possible solution could be a specialized plugin for Keptn using Keptn REST API and/or CLI. It might be also possible to create a unified plugin for Keptn and other CI/CD tools, e.g. implemented on the top of the Cloud Events / CDEvents standard.
- Expected outcome: Finding issues blocking multiple control planes, and possibly fixing them.
- Recommended Skills: Typescript, Javascript, React, Backstage

- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/keptn/integrations/issues/19

#### Build Standard KeptnTaskDefinition Library
- Description: [Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit (KLT)](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit) can run pre and post deployment tasks. Currently KLT supports the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime. KeptnTasks can be used for almost anything that an individual can dream up and script in JavaScript. However, users (especially new adopters) usually need a useful set of example tasks that they can use and / or modify to suit their requirements.

This project would build such a library of re-usable tasks for common tasks such as:

- Notifying Chat tools
- Triggering external tools (eg. a pipeline)
- Integrations with Systems of Record (i.e. to update a CMDB)

This project lends itself to GSoC due to the modular nature of the tasks which almost guarantees that something will be delivered - the task delivery can be planned an organised easily into sprints across the project lifecycle. It is also relatively easy - given that the tasks are simply JavaScript - it should be easy for most first time contributors.

- Expected outcome: A catalogue of useful, re-usable `KeptnTaskDefinitions` that will serve as useful reference material for adopters
- Recommended Skills: Typescript and / or JavaScript, basic understanding of Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit, Kubernetes basic knowledge, knowledge of CRDs

### OpenFeature

#### Streamlined OpenFeature Enhancement Proposal Process

- Description: It‚Äôs important that non-trivial changes in OpenFeature are agreed upon and documented. The OpenFeature Enhancement Proposal process should be used to gather community feedback and ensure overall alignment with the project. This process should be streamlined to encourage community participation by creating documentation, scripts, and automated workflows.
- Expected outcome: Create an end-to-end workflow for creating, reviewing, approving, and publishing OpenFeature Enhancement Proposals.
- Recommended Skills: TypeScript, Python, GitHub Actions
- Mentor(s): Michael Beemer @beeme1mr (michael.beemer at dynatrace dot com), David Hirsch @DavidPHirsch (david.hirsch at dynatrace dot com)

### Curve

#### Support metadata of Curve Block Storage stored in the database

- Description: Currently the [metadata](https://github.com/opencurve/curve/blob/master/src/mds/nameserver2/namespace_storage.cpp) of current CurveBS is stored in [Etcd](https://github.com/opencurve/curve/tree/master/src/kvstorageclient). However, Etcd has limited scalability, and the amount of metadata that can be stored is limited. In order to support larger clusters, it is hoped that the metadata can add a sql database like mysql, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc. as one of the storage engines. Add a new sqlstorageclient for [metadata](https://github.com/opencurve/curve/blob/master/src/mds/nameserver2/namespace_storage.cpp).
- Expected outcome: It is hoped that the user can choose whether the metadata is stored in the kv engine or the sql engine through the configuration file.
- Recommended Skills: C++, SQL

#### Add compression feature for Curve snapshot

- Description: Curve snapshots are currently uploaded to s3, and no compression is used. Using compression can greatly reduce the space occupied by snapshots, thereby saving storage costs.
- Expected outcome: 1Ôºâ Detailed Design Documentation 2Ôºâ Realize curve snapshot compression upload and download decompression 3Ôºâ Add unit tests and integration test cases 4Ôºâ Merge your PR into the opencurve repo
- Recommended Skills: C++
- Mentor(s): Chaojie Xu @xu-chaojie (xuchaojie@outlook.com)
- Expected project size: 175 hours
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/opencurve/curve/issues/2223

#### Add Tracing feature for Curve

- Description: At present, Curve has logging and metrics, both of which can be used to analyze performance as well as locate problems. While they improve the observability of the system, the granularity is coarse and does not allow for precise analysis of how long requests take at each stage. Tracing is a powerful tool that can concatenate invocation relationships between services and log invocation time in the request dimension, preserving essential information and concatenating dispersed log events to help us better understand system behavior, assist in debugging and troubleshooting performance issues.
- Expected outcome: Design the solution and implement it, introduce it into CurveBS, and analyze the latency of IO requests. The implementation needs to be well scalable and can be applied to other modules.
- Recommended Skills: C++, OpenTracing

### CRI-O

#### Add additional log drivers to conmon-rs

- Description: conmon-rs is a container monitor written in Rust, used by CRI-O to monitor a container's lifecycle. Part of its responsibilities is log forwarding--taking the output of the container and writing that output to various places. Currently, conmon-rs supports one format: the one required by the Kubernetes CRI. The goal of this proposal is to add new log formats from the list of standardized ones, like JSON, Splunk, Journald. 
- Expected outcome: A JSON log driver and Journald log driver are added to conmon-rs. A stretch goal of adding a Splunk log driver is also within scope.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, familiarity with containers

- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/containers/conmon-rs/issues/1126

#### Add podman support in conmon-rs

- Description: conmon-rs is a container monitor written in Rust, used by CRI-O to monitor a container's lifecycle. In order to declare stability of conmon-rs for CRI-O, many features have to be added for its sibling project: [podman](podman.io). The goal of this proposal is to add additional features that are required by podman to conmon-rs, so conmon-rs can be stabalied
- Expected outcome: Additional CreateContainer request options are added and supported in conmon-rs to finalize support for podman. Further, the RestoreContainer RPC should be added and supported.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, familiarity with containers

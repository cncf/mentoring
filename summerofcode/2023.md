## Ideas

### Jaeger

#### Implement ClickHouse support

- Description: Jaeger (https://jaegertracing.io) is a popular platform for distributed tracing. ClickHouse is a powerful columnar database, utilized in many commercial and some open source monitoring products. Jaeger currently has a community-provided (unofficial) plugin that implements Jaeger storage backend on top of ClickHouse. This project is to build first-class support for ClickHouse in Jaeger as a core functionality.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Design table schema, document trade-offs
  - Implement ClickHouse support as core storage backend
  - Address schema creation problem / tooling
  - Add relevant documentation to the Jaeger website
- Stretch goals:
  - Use Kafka Connector for ClickHouse for bulk inserts
  - Support Monitoring tab in Jaeger directly from ClickHouse
- Recommended Skills: Go, SQL
- Mentor(s): Yuri Shkuro, @yurishkuro
- Expected project size: 350 Hours
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4196

### Knative

#### Multiple Knative Eventing control planes

- Description: We see more users asking for complete isolation in Knative Eventing deployments. While there are Knative Eventing components that support isolated data planes, we are interested in to see isolated control planes as well. There were discussions about this in the community before and many of the asks were left unadressed. However, we have tools that support multitenancy today, such as [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp). We see this project as an experiment.
- Expected outcome: Finding issues blocking multiple control planes, and possibly fixing them.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Knative, Kubernetes Controllers
- Mentor(s):  Ali Ok @aliok (aliok AT redhat DOT com), Christoph St√§bler @creydr (cstaebler AT redhat DOT com)
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Hard
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/6601

#### Eventing Sender Identity

- Description: Leveraging Kubernetes Service Account identity and OAuth audiences, users should be able to configure Knative Eventing components to authenticate CloudEvent deliveries using the identity of the Subscription, Trigger, or Source. Additionally, Brokers and Channels can leverage the OAuth identity associated with incoming CloudEvents to implement policy.
- Expected outcome: At least the following components are able to use service accounts for authentication: in-memory-channel, multitenant broker, apiserver source, ping source. Ideally, the primitives from this project could be re-used by other channel and broker implementations.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, OAuth or OIDC
- Mentor(s): Evan Anderson @evankanderson
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/5047

#### NetworkPolicy support for Knative Serving

- Description: Implement port-level network routing for Knative Serving internal addresses. This will be an extension of https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/pull/852 to other Knative Ingress implementations, along with implementation of default NetworkPolicies for the activator and Knative Revisions to enforce that requests are routed through the Knative Ingress.
- Expected outcome: Users will be able to use NetworkPolicy to restrict access to their Knative Services at a network (L4 / TCP) level.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes networking, Envoy or protocol familiarity with HTTP

#### Improving Observability in Knative Eventing

- Description: We see users struggling to observe what happens inside Knative Eventing and we want that to be improved by providing easy to use tools. The idea is divided into stages. First stage is to write code (python and/or golang) that implements a plugin for Knative command-line interface (kn CLI). The plugin takes output from observability data gathered by Knative and answers simple questions such as: where did my event go based on event id? Show clusters/groups of common traces and show exceptions? The plugin should be able to verify that necessary Knative configuration for observability is enabled, access server side components. Possible next stages may be to create active probes that add to CLI capability to send probe events to specific Knative components (such as Kafka source or broker) and report if they work as expected (health checks). Another area to explore is using conversational AI to improve the plugin by using AI to parse natural language input and/or process available observability data for common Knative questions. As part of the work there may be proposed fixes and improvements for identified gaps in Knative observability that may be discovered when testing the plugin.
- Expected outcome: Improved Knative Eventing observability, improved documentation and published one or more blog posts
- Recommended Skills: Python, data science skills, Golang, Kubernetes

#### Dataplane migration for Apache Kafka communications: From Vert.x to Project Loom

- Description: The Knative Broker's data-plane communication with Apache Kafka for consuming and producing records is currently done via the Vertx Kafka client [library](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-kafka-client). The library is basically a wrapper for communications with Apache Kafka inside of the Vertx threading model. This project requires an evaluation the OpenJDK 19 ["Project Loom"](https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/loom) itself and how to leverage it for efficient communications with an Apache Kafka cluster. The goal of the project is to migrate the usage of Vertx for any communications with Apache Kafka to pure OpenJDK 19's Loom, and reduce the number of 3rd party frameworks, such as vertx for Apache Kafka communication.
- Expected outcome: OpenJDK 19 gets evaluated for our use case, Knative Kafka Broker gets migrated to use Loom for Apache Kafka communication.
- Recommended Skills: Java, Apache Kafka, understanding of Kubernetes

#### Porting Knative Serving to Microshift

- Description: More and more workload is moving towards running on the edge. We saw experiments running Kubernetes on vehicles, fighter jets, 5G antenna and various far edge, near edge and fat edge environments. We would like to see what the challenges are when Knative is run in a resource limited environment. While there are multiple edge-friendly Kubernetes distributions, we would like to see [Microshift](https://github.com/openshift/microshift) used as the base platform. Knative consists of Serving and Eventing modules but focusing on Knative Serving as a first step should be more approachable. The project consists of 2 stages. First one is to run Knative on Microshift with minimal resources. This requires finding out problems here, solving them. A stretch goal is to find out what happens with architectures other than x86_64.
- Expected outcome:  Having Knative Serving with an ingress layer running on top of Microshift. Having a Hello-World Knative Service running on top. Finding issues blocking the edge setup, and possibly fixing them.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Knative, good understanding of networking, good understanding of CI/CD

#### Self-Balancing Knative Kafka Broker partitions

- Description: Creating a Knative Kafka Broker requires developers to specify the number of partitions the backing Kafka topic should have, however, this is not an easy decision to make and it requires planning based on the expected load the Knative Broker could receive. This project aims to remove this configuration setting by having an autoscaler that is responsible to add or remove partitions based on the effective load the Knative Kafka Broker receives while preserving [ordered and unordered delivery features](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/brokers/broker-types/kafka-broker/#configuring-the-order-of-delivered-events) for Triggers.
- Expected outcome: A Knative Kafka Broker can be created without setting the number of partitions and the number of partitions for a topic backing the Knative Kafka Broker increases or decreases based on the observed load received.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Go, Java

### KubeVela

#### Vela IDE Plugins

- Description: With more and more developers start writing KubeVela (OAM) application YAML file and CUE-based X-Definitions, it is increasingly important to provide some tools to help user make correct configurations. IDE plugin is one way to reach that. We can make VSCode/Jetbrains plugins for formatting and previewing the written applications and KubeVela's X-Definitions. The plugin should be able to sync environment data (including installed X-Definitions) and make dryrun preview for the rendering result of applications intelligently. It can also provide preview capability for the selected clusters when topology policy is written. Live-diff for the current application and remote application configuration is useful as well. In addition to the application, when users write X-Defintinitions based on CUELang, auto validating and previewing for rendering results under mock inputs can also support them.
- Expected outcome: IDE Plugins for KubeVela, or standalone desktop apps
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, NodeJS, KubeVela, CUELang
- Mentor(s): Da Yin @Somefive
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Hard

### Strimzi

#### Proof of Concept of an MQTT to Apache Kafka bridge for producing messages

- Description: A really common use case we have been seeing is about enabling an IoT scenario with MQTT based devices and using an Apache Kafka cluster as the events and storage platform running on Kubernetes via Strimzi. In order to do that, there is the need to map the MQTT protocol to the custom Apache Kafka one and bridge from one to the other. This project idea is about designing such a mapping and developing a pure [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/4.1/codec-mqtt/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/mqtt) based MQTT server component (not a full MQTT broker) able to accept MQTT client connections and handling the corresponding communication based on the [MQTT 3.1.1 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html). Finally, developing the Kafka producer part to get messages from MQTT clients and sending them to an Apache Kafka cluster.
- Expected outcome: POC source code for an MQTT to Apache Kafka bridge
- Recommended Skills: Java, MQTT protocol (not mandatory but to be learned)

### WasmEdge

#### Serialization Completion

- Description: WasmEdge is a WebAssembly runtime in both interpreter and ahead-of-time mode. However, WasmEdge only supports the binary format for the input WebAssembly file. To help the text format WebAssembly loader feature in the future, the implementation of serializing a WebAssembly module is necessary. In this mentorship, we hope the mentee should complete the serialization functions already in [the `dev/serialize` branch](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/dev/serialize) of the `WasmEdge` repo.
- Expected outcome: Complete the serialization functions of WebAssembly modules, such as the element segment and data segment encoding. Complete the WebAssembly instructions encoding. Generate the unit test data and pass the unit tests. >80% of code coverage for serialization.
- Recommended Skills: C/C++, WebAssembly
- Mentors: Yi-Ying He @q82419 (yiying at secondstate dot io), Hung-Ying Tai @hydai (hydai at secondstate dot io)
- Expected project size: 350h
- Difficulty: Medium
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2262

#### `zlib` Plugin Support

- Description: The zlib is required for compiling and running many existing C / C++ / Rust apps in Wasm. Most noticeably, it is [needed in the Python port to Wasm](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93819). The VMWare Wasm Labs team is using a zlib port from [Singlestore](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/python-wasi) in [their Python Wasm runtime](https://wasmlabs.dev/articles/python-wasm32-wasi/). In WasmEdge, we could support the zlib host functions through our [plugin system](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/plugin.html). This way, any existing zlib apps can be compiled to Wasm and runs inside WasmEdge.
- Expected outcome: Create a new [WasmEdge plugin](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/plugin.html) that exports all public functions in `zlib`. Implement SDK (in C/Rust) that uses the C ABI to generate corresponding headers for the above plugin. Generate the unit tests and pass the unit tests. >80% of code coverage for verification.
- Recommended Skills: C/C++, Rust, WebAssembly
- Mentors: Yi-Ying He @q82419 (yiying at secondstate dot io), Hung-Ying Tai @hydai (hydai at secondstate dot io)

## Project Ideas

If you are a project maintainer and consider mentoring during the GSoC 2021 cycle, please, submit your ideas below using the [template](/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md).

### Kubernetes

#### Cluster Addons: CRI-based CSI Volume Image Driver

- Description: The [csi-driver-image-populator](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-image-populator) is a CSI plugin that allows you to mount the contents of a container image as a volume in a container, but it does not use the node's CRI endpoint to pull images. This means that images pulled as volumes will have different configuration (proxy, auth, mirror, etc) from other images run a cluster. A version of of the csi-driver-image-populator that uses a node's CRI provider to pull images would avoid that problem and make it simpler to build on-cluster tooling that makes use of [manifest bundles](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-cluster-lifecycle/addons/2494-Manifest-Bundle). It may also be worth looking at the CSI / CRI interfaces to see if improvements can be made to simplify the driver, or to enable the use of [OCI artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts).
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Evan Cordell (@ecordell)
- Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-addons/issues/100

#### Web-based Simulator for the Kubernetes Scheduler

- Description: [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io) (k8s) is a production-grade container-orchestration system. The [k8s scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/) decides which pods (containers) should go to which machines to be run. Not everyone has a running cluster lying around, so a web-based simulator that simulates the scheduler's behavior serves as an excellent interactive learning tool.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Adhityaa Chandrasekar (@adtac)
- Issue(s): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99605

### Strimzi

#### Add support for changing a KafkaTopic's `replicationFactor`

- The [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) project provides an easy way of running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. It uses KafkaTopic custom resources to provide a cloud-native way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster. Strimzi also uses [Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) to provide Kafka cluster balancing functions. This project would add support for changing a KafkaTopicâ€™s replicationFactor property by using Cruise Control.
- Recommended Skills: Java
- Mentor(s): Tom Bentley (@tombentley), Tom Cooper (@tomncooper)
- Issue: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/191

### TiKV

#### TLA+ Specification for async commit

- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) has recently been launching a new feature in the transaction model named [Async commit](https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/tree/master/design/async-commit). It's an optimization that reduces the commit latency from 2PC to 1PC. However, this feature has not been reflected in the [TLA+ Specs](https://github.com/pingcap/tla-plus/tree/master/DistributedTransaction). This project aims to update the spec and to run TLC model checker on the new model to gain more confidence in the async commit design.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Rust, TLA+
- Mentor(s): Ziqian Qin (@ekexium), Andy Lok (@andylokandy)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/issues/97

#### High-performance data import tool

- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) currently lacks a robust tool to import great amount of data. But, in fact, TiKV has implemented [`sst_importer`](https://github.com/pingcap/kvproto/blob/3cd2fc5fad226caeffed72297e3e13a571f5592e/proto/import_sstpb.proto#L34) to fast import SQL data to TiDB by [`Lightning`](https://github.com/pingcap/br) tool. `Lightning` imports SQL data in two steps: translating SQL data in KV pairs and importing KV pairs into TiKV. By exposing the second steps, we can support importing KV-like data into TiKV, e.g. migrating from HBase to TiKV.
- Recommended Skills: Go
- Mentor(s): Kenny (@kennytm), Andy Lok (@andylokandy)
- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/9778

### CoreDNS

#### Add ACME protocol support for certificate management with DNS

- [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is a cloud-native DNS server with a focus on service discovery. While best known as the default DNS server for Kubernetes, CoreDNS is capable of handle many other scenarios within or outside of Kubernetes clusters for make easy infrastructure management. One such case is the certificate management. This project is to provide ACME protocol support so that it is possible to have automatic certificate management through CoreDNS. More details and discussions are available in https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, DNS, TLS, Certificate Management
- Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang), Paul Greenberg (@greenpau)
- Issue: https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460

### Keptn

#### Provide a hub for Keptn integrations, extensions & services

- The [Keptn project](https://keptn.sh) is a cloud-native application life-cycle orchestrator, acting as a control-plane for different tools for deploying, testing, etc of your applications. Currently, Keptn services and integrations can be found on an overview page. While this served fine as a central overview of all currently supported integrations, a more sophisticated "integrations hub" is desired.
- Recommended Skills: Angular/TypeScript
- Mentor(s): Juergen Etzlstorfer (@jetzlstorfer)
- Issue: https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/3406

### Tremor

#### Add plugin support for tremor (PDK)

- Description: The PDK or (plugin development kit) aims to allow loading artifacts into tremor at runtime instead of requiring a full recompilation. This streamlines the development process of extending tremor with custom functionality. The goal is to allow live loading of a number of artifacts so start with: Pipeline Operators, Codecs, Pre- and Postprocessors, Custom Functions.
- Recommended Skills: rust, Linux
- Mentor(s): Darach Ennis (@darach), Matthias Wahl (@mfelsche)
- Issue: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/issues/791

#### Add gRPC client and server support to tremor

- Description: gRPC is an industry-standard API abstraction and runtime. Currently, tremor supports interfacing with the outside world over WebSockets, HTTP/1.1, or target-specific connectors. Adding support for gRPC will allow generalizing a whole lot of client and server connections and making interfacing with other cloud-native applications easier. The goal of this project is to add support for such generic gRPC based services.
- Recommended Skills: rust, Linux, http/2, protocol buffers
- Mentor(s): Heinz Gies (@Licenser), Anup Dhamala (@anupdhml)
- Issue: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/issues/790

### cert-manager

#### Improve the usability of cert-manager on multiple cloud providers

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) is one of the most popular Kubernetes addons. It introduces Certificate Authorities and Certificates as custom resource types in the Kubernetes API, and enables automatically managed certificate rotation. While the most common use is publicly trusted ACME certificates for Ingress controllers, it can also be used to manage identites in service meshes such as Istio. The project is to improve the user experience of deploying cert-manager on different cloud providers, helping to diagnose, fix and recommend workarounds for any discovered issues.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Infrastructure as Code
- Mentors: Jake Sanders (@jakexks), team-cert-manager@Jetstack
- Issue: https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/3720

#### `kubectl cert-manager install`: A CLI plugin to make it easy to install and verify the installation of cert-manager

- Description: cert-manager can be [installed using Helm or with regular Kubernetes manifests](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/),
  but when using regular manifests it is difficult to customize the deployment.
  This CLI will make it easier for non-Helm users to customize the configuration of cert-manager,
  it will provide a way to see all the configuration options for a cert-manager deployment from the command line
  (i.e. by running kubectl cert-manager install --help).
  It will provide an option to wait for and verify the deployment, perhaps by integrating the code of [cert-manager-verifier](https://github.com/alenkacz/cert-manager-verifier).
  And it may become the foundation of a future `kubectl cert-manager upgrade` command, which will help users safely upgrade and downgrade between cert-manager versions.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentors: team-cert-manager@Jetstack
- Issue: https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/3783

### LitmusChaos

#### Rewrite litmus portal authentication server and add third-party integration of Gmail and Github.

- [LitmusChaos](https://litmuschaos.io) is a Kubernetes native chaos engineering framework that helps SREs & developers find weaknesses in their deployments, with the chaos intent being defined via custom resources. The goal of this project is to rewrite the authentication server to make it modular and lightweight. Also, add third-party integration of Gmail and Github.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, MongoDB.
- Mentors: Karthik Satchitanand (@ksatchit), Raj Babu Das (@rajdas98)
- Issue: https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/issues/2483

### Envoy

#### Adaptive Load Control and Distributed Load Testing of Envoy Data Planes

- Description: Users configuring their Envoy-based data planes don't know how to find the optimal Envoy configuration given their workload's resiliency and performance requirements. Nighthawk, Envoy's load generator, supports adaptive load control and horizontally distributed scaling of itself. Using distributed load testing and the creation of a set of adaptive load controllers, Envoy users can be empowered with repeatable tooling to automate identification of an optimal Envoy data plane configuration.
- Recommended Skill(s): Golang, C++, Rust
- Issue(s): https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-perf/issues/72
- Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@lcalcote), Otto van der Schaaf (@oschaaf)

### Open Service Mesh

##### Support for WebAssembly filters

- Description: Bring OSM on par with other service meshes that support WASM filters in their data plane. OSM's Envoy proxies can be extended at runtime with filters that are running in a WebAssembly sandbox (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-wasm). Provide ability to dynamically load and unload Envoy WASM filters. Provide general purpose filtering of application infrastrcuture logic, tying business logic closer to the mesh.
- Recommended Skills: golang, rust
- Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@leecalcote), Abishek Kumar (@kumarabd)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/issues/1671

### Service Mesh Interface

##### Support for Multi-Cluster Operations

- Description: Facilitate federation service mesh deployments across Kubernetes clusters, considering for service catalog federation and
  identity federation. Account for 1) multiple Kubernetes clusters using the same service mesh, 2) hetrogenius workloads (Kubernetes, VMs, Bare metal) using the same service mesh, 3) multiple Kubernetes clusters using different service meshes (e.g. Istio and Linkerd), 4) heterogeneous workloads using different service meshes (e.g. Istio, Consul).
- Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, meshery, smi
- Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@leecalcote), Abishek Kumar (@kumarabd)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/issues/212

### OpenEBS

#### Add support for updating mountpoints and capacity of devices using dmesg parser

- [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) is the leading Container Attached Storage solution. OpenEBS NDM exposes storage devices on the hosts as BlockDevice custom resources. The capacity and mountpoints of these devices can change dynamically on the host and openebs needs to update it in the custom resources, without doing a full reinitialization. The goal is to update this information by parsing dmesg and thus provide the latest information to the users.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Linux
- Mentor(s): Akhil Mohan (@akhilerm)
- Issue: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3135

### Prometheus

#### Implement configurable retention time for Prometheus series

- Description: Currently, Prometheus data is deleted after a configurable amount of time, or once the disk size reaches a configured limit. However, many users would like to keep some data, such as the result of recording rules or SLO data, for a longer period of time than higher cardinality raw data. The goal of this project is to allow users to configure Prometheus to configure the retention time on a per series basis.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Chris Marchbanks (@csmarchbanks), Bartlomiej Plotka (@bwplotka)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1381

#### Port the Prometheus API to OpenAPI

- Description: Prometheus offers rest API of all sorts but they are not well
  documented. The idea would be to use OpenAPI to have self-documentation and
  specification files to be used by third parties. This would enable the use of
  Prometheus API's with clients from any languages easily.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Julien Pivotto (@roidelapluie)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2392

### Thanos

#### Smart automation for project documentation and website

- Description: In Thanos we donâ€™t like manual work. Thatâ€™s why we try to automate as much as we can, ensuring our documentation is up to date, links are working and documentation works from both GitHub and Website. We want to consolidate our automation and scripts to separate projects called mdox, so itâ€™s working more reliably and helping other projects too! This project is to finish that work and allows students to have a great impact in the project tooling community. NOTE: This is a documentation tooling project, not related strictly to Thanos/Prometheus distributed systems - itâ€™s a great starting point for passionate person interested in working with Go and wanting a soft intro to Cloud Native project maintenance topics!
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Bartlomiej Plotka (@bwplotka)
- Issue: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/3081

#### Automated, Granular TLS client support in Thanos

- Description: Thanos Querier component supports basic TLS configuration for internal gRPC communication. This works great for basic use cases but it still requires extra forward proxies to make it work for bigger deployments. Itâ€™s also hard to rotate certificates automatically and configure safe mTLS. This project aims to remove those simplifications allowing better TLS story for all Thanos metrics APIs!
- Recommended Skills: go, distributed systems, TLS, gRPC
- Mentor(s): Bartek Plotka (@bwplotka), Kemal Akkoyun (@kakkoyun)
- Issue: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/977

### Crossplane

#### Upgrade OAM Implementation in Crossplane to Latest Release of Spec

- Description: [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) is an open source Kubernetes add-on that supercharges your Kubernetes clusters enabling you to provision and manage infrastructure, services, and applications. Under the hood, it leverage Open Application Model to define and ship applications across clusters in an developer centric approach. Currently, the [implementation in Crossplane is OAM spec v0.2.1](https://github.com/crossplane/oam-kubernetes-runtime) and didn't fully reflect the latest release of upstream specification. This proposal will help Crossplane catch up with the latest change.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Ryan Zhang (@ryanzhang-oss), Sun Jianbo (@wonderflow)
- Issue(s): https://github.com/crossplane/oam-kubernetes-runtime/issues/321

### Cloud Native Buildpacks

##### Buildpack Registry Github Action Updates

- Description: This project would ensure that the [Buildpack Registry Index](https://github.com/buildpacks/registry-index/) and [Buildpack Registry Namespace](https://github.com/buildpacks/registry-namespaces/) repositories are updated with the latest [Github Actions](https://github.com/buildpacks/github-actions) version automatically after it is released.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Github Actions
- Mentor(s): Joe Kutner (@jkutner)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/buildpacks/github-actions/issues/40

##### Jenkins Plugin

- Description: Cloud Native Buildpacks' primary function is to turn source code into a runnable image and because of that it's natural for it to be used within common CI/CD platform pipelines. This project would focus on creating a pipeline plugin that makes it easy for users to use Cloud Native Buildpacks within [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/).
- Recommended Skills: Java, Docker
- Mentor(s): Javier Romero (@jromero)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/531

##### Lifecycle Prepare Phase

- Description: A Lifecycle Prepare phase should make it easier for platforms to achieve parity with features of Pack. Today, features like [`project.toml`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/using-project-descriptor/) are only supported by Pack, and a new platform would need to write itâ€™s own parser. This project would include design (writing an RFC), specification (updating the CNB spec), and implementation (writing the code for the phase in [Lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle)).
- Recommended Skills: Go
- Mentor(s): Joe Kutner (@jkutner), Natalie Arellano (@natalieparellano)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/issues/555

### in-toto

#### Develop in-toto-rs (Rust) for integration with rebuilderd

- Description: [rebuilderd](https://github.com/kpcyrd/rebuilderd) is a verification system for binary packages. It repeats the build process of a package in an identical environment and verifies that the package is identical. It is part of the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) effort and can currently be used to [rebuild Arch Linux packages](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/archlinux.html). The rebuild must optionally generate in-toto link attestations which can be used to verify the entire process. To that end, the nascent [in-toto-rs](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-rs) library must be developed to enable this integration with rebuilderd.
- Recommended Skills: Rust
- Mentor(s): Santiago Torres-Arias (@SantiagoTorres)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-rs/issues/4

#### Add support for new signature specification, complying with ITE-5

- Description: The in-toto team is working with the TUF project to replace the current signature wrapper used by both projects. This effort has resulted in the [signing-spec](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/signing-spec). The new specification removes the current dependence on canonicalization and is open to encodings other than JSON. Further, moving the signature specification out helps the in-toto specification focus on its key goals, making it more readable. The switch to the new signature specification is proposed in an in-toto Enhancement, [ITE-5](https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/pull/13). The task at hand is adding support to the in-toto reference implementation for the new specification.
- Recommended Skills: Python
- Mentor(s): Santiago Torres-Arias (@SantiagoTorres), Aditya Sirish A Yelgundhalli (@adityasaky)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/445 

### TUF

#### Hashed bin delegations

- Description: The Update Framework (TUF) supports delegating responsibility for signing images. In order to support a large number of delegations, the [specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#file-formats-targetsjson-and-delegated-target-roles--file-formats-targets) supports binning delegations based on their hash. This project would involve adding this feature to the [go implementation](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf) of TUF.
- Recommended Skills: Go
- Mentor(s): Marina Moore (@mnm678)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/issues/45

### Pravega

#### Dynamic Auto-scaling

- Description: Dynamic scaling of the Pravega Cluster by the [pravega-operator](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-operator) using [HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/). This should be simple to implement, and we've already done [a successful POC](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-operator/issues/131).
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): Prajakta Belgundi (@pbelgundi)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/pravega/pravega-operator/issues/483

### Write logs to Pravega

- Recommended Skills: Java, Rust, Python, C#, a language with gRPC bindings
- Mentor(s): Andrei Paduroiu (@andreipaduroiu)

### SLTS ChunkStorage implementations

- Description: [Simplified Long Term Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyd1_t3c6LE) allows Pravega to use almost any storage API for Stream storage. Pravega has ChunkStorage implementations for [Extended S3 (ECS)](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/bindings/src/main/java/io/pravega/storage/extendeds3/ExtendedS3ChunkStorage.java), [HDFS](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/bindings/src/main/java/io/pravega/storage/hdfs/HDFSChunkStorage.java), [NFS](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/bindings/src/main/java/io/pravega/storage/filesystem/FileSystemChunkStorage.java) and [BookKeeper/BlobIt](https://github.com/diegosalvi/pravega-blobit-chunkmanager). Write a [ChunkStorage](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/segmentstore/storage/src/main/java/io/pravega/segmentstore/storage/chunklayer/ChunkStorage.java) implementation for GCP or Azure.

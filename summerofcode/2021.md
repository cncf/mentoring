## Project Ideas

If you are a project maintainer and consider mentoring during the GSoC 2021 cycle, please, submit your ideas below using the [template](/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md).

For example:

### Prometheus (sample):

#### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead

- Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor(s): Krasi Georgiev (@krasi-georgiev)
- Issue: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3416

### Strimzi

#### Add support for changing a KafkaTopic's `replicationFactor`

- The [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) project provides an easy way of running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. It uses KafkaTopic custom resources to provide a cloud-native way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster. Strimzi also uses [Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) to provide Kafka cluster balancing functions. This project would add support for changing a KafkaTopicâ€™s replicationFactor property by using Cruise Control.
- Recommended Skills: Java
- Mentor(s): Tom Bentley (@tombentley), Tom Cooper (@tomncooper)
- Issue: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/191

### TiKV

#### TLA+ Specification for async commit

- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) has recently been launching a new feature in the transaction model named [Async commit](https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/tree/master/design/async-commit). It's an optimization that reduces the commit latency from 2PC to 1PC. However, this feature has not been reflected in the [TLA+ Specs](https://github.com/pingcap/tla-plus/tree/master/DistributedTransaction). This project aims to update the spec and to run TLC model checker on the new model to gain more confidence in the async commit design.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Rust, TLA+

- Issue: https://github.com/tikv/sig-transaction/issues/97

#### High-performance data import tool

- [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) currently lacks a robust tool to import great amount of data. But, in fact, TiKV has implemented [`sst_importer`](https://github.com/pingcap/kvproto/blob/3cd2fc5fad226caeffed72297e3e13a571f5592e/proto/import_sstpb.proto#L34) to fast import SQL data to TiDB by [`Lightning`](https://github.com/pingcap/br) tool. `Lightning` imports SQL data in two steps: translating SQL data in KV pairs and importing KV pairs into TiKV. By exposing the second steps, we can support importing KV-like data into TiKV, e.g. migrating from HBase to TiKV.

### CoreDNS

#### Add ACME protocol support for certificate management with DNS

- [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is a cloud-native DNS server with a focus on service discovery. While best known as the default DNS server for Kubernetes, CoreDNS is capable of handle many other scenarios within or outside of Kubernetes clusters for make easy infrastructure management. One such case is the certificate management. This project is to provide ACME protocol support so that it is possible to have automatic certificate management through CoreDNS. More details and discussions are available in https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, DNS, TLS, Certificate Management
- Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang)
- Issue: https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460

### Keptn

#### Provide a hub for Keptn integrations, extensions & services

- The [Keptn project](https://keptn.sh) is a cloud-native application life-cycle orchestrator, acting as a control-plane for different tools for deploying, testing, etc of your applications. Currently, Keptn services and integrations can be found on an overview page. While this served fine as a central overview of all currently supported integrations, a more sophisticated "integrations hub" is desired.
- Recommended Skills: Angular/TypeScript
- Mentor(s): Juergen Etzlstorfer (@jetzlstorfer)
- Issue: https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/3406

### Tremor

#### Add plugin support for tremor (PDK)

- Description: The PDK or (plugin development kit) aims to allow loading artifacts into tremor at runtime instead of requiring a full recompilation. This streamlines the development process of extending tremor with custom functionality. The goal is to allow live loading of a number of artifacts so start with: Pipeline Operators, Codecs, Pre- and Postprocessors, Custom Functions.
- Recommended Skills: rust, Linux
- Mentor(s): Darach Ennis (@darach), Matthias Wahl (@mfelsche)
- Issue: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/issues/791

#### Add gRPC client and server support to tremor

- Description: gRPC is an industry-standard API abstraction and runtime. Currently, tremor supports interfacing with the outside world over WebSockets, HTTP/1.1, or target-specific connectors. Adding support for gRPC will allow generalizing a whole lot of client and server connections and making interfacing with other cloud-native applications easier. The goal of this project is to add support for such generic gRPC based services.
- Recommended Skills: rust, Linux, http/2, protocol buffers
- Mentor(s): Heinz Gies (@Licenser), Anup Dhamala (@anupdhml)
- Issue: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/issues/790

### cert-manager

#### Improve the usability of cert-manager on multiple cloud providers

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) is one of the most popular Kubernetes addons. It introduces Certificate Authorities and Certificates as custom resource types in the Kubernetes API, and enables automatically managed certificate rotation. While the most common use is publicly trusted ACME certificates for Ingress controllers, it can also be used to manage identites in service meshes such as Istio. The project is to improve the user experience of deploying cert-manager on different cloud providers, helping to diagnose, fix and recommend workarounds for any discovered issues.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Infrastructure as Code
- Mentors: Jake Sanders (@jakexks), team-cert-manager@Jetstack
- Issue: https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/3720

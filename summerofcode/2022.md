However, there is currently no Python implementation that can be used by in-toto and other projects. The aim of this project is to fix that by writing a fully featured and well tested DSSE implementation, and using it to allow users to generate in-toto metadata using DSSE rather than the legacy signature wrapper.
- Recommended Skills: Python
- Mentor(s): Aditya Sirish (@adityasaky), Lukas Pühringer (@lukpueh)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/445

#### Add provenance extension to Jenkins plugin

Description: The [in-toto Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/in-toto-plugin/) allows users to generate in-toto link metadata in their build pipelines. However, with ITE-6 and the in-toto Attestations project, the plugin must also be capable of generating other in-toto attestations such as the [provenance specification](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2). The aim of this project is to refactor the Jenkins plugin to allow for new attestation types, as well as to implement the provenance attestation. The [in-toto-java implementation](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-java) can be leveraged to create the new attestations in the Jenkins plugin.

### The Update Framework (TUF)

#### User-controlled key management

- Description: Write an implementation of [TAP 13](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap13.md) in the [go implementation](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf) of TUF. TUF metadata provides key management for developers who want to sign packages that they upload to a repository. However, this means that users are trusting the repository administrators to accurately portray the correct signing key for each package. TAP 13 reduces trust in repository administrators by adding support for user-managed keys to TUF, allowing users to override the key management done by the repository to trust only a subset of images on that repository. The implementation will be built on the new python-tuf client.
- Recommended Skills: go
- Mentors: Marina Moore (@mnm678)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/issues/137

#### Managing TUF Versions
- Description: Implement [version management](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap14.md) for TUF’s python reference implementation. The implementation does not currently have a way to migrate TUF repositories or clients to a new TUF version that has breaking changes. This project will be the implementation of a proposal for coordinating specification versions between a repository and a client to prevent interruptions in access to updates after a major version change to the specification.
- Recommended Skills: python
- Mentors: Marina Moore (@mnm678), Zack Newman (@znewman01)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/issues/136

#### Succinct hashed bin delegations
- Description: Improve hashed bin delegations in TUF by adding [succinct hashed bin delegations](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap15.md) to the python-tuf reference implementation. TUF delegations allow the repository to specify which developer (or signing key) is associated with which packages are downloaded using TUF. Hashed bin delegations allow TUF to delegate many projects to the same signing keys more efficiently. However, the current implementation has a lot of duplicated metadata that can be simplified without affecting the functionality of this feature. This project would be implementing these simplifications to hashed bin delegations.
- Recommended Skills: Python
- Mentors: Marina Moore (@mnm678), Lukas Pühringer (@lukpueh), Zack Newman (@znewman01)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/issues/132

#### Repository Tool
- Description: The Metadata API of the python-tuf reference implementation provides a modern API for accessing individual pieces of TUF metadata. It does not, however, provide any wider context help to someone looking to implement a TUF repository. The goal of this project is to implement a minimal repository abstraction that includes carefully selected core functionality, without implementing all repository actions itself. Instead it should become easy for application code on top of such an abstraction to perform those actions autonomously, while maintaining compliance with the TUF specification.
- Recommended Skills: Python
- Mentors: Lukas Pühringer (@lukpueh)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/issues/1136

### Keylime

#### Support push model for agent attestation

- Description: [Keylime](http://keylime.dev) enables users to monitor remote nodes (file integrity and measured boot) using a hardware based cryptographic root of trust. Keylime currently operates on a pull basis which means that the tenant or verifier connect to the agent to collect attestation data. This works fine in most virtualized environments where all the devices are in the same network, but not for edge devices or in BYOD contexts. This work would allow remote nodes to work in a "push" model instead of the normal "pull" model.
- Recommended Skills: Python, Security
- Mentor(s): Thore Sommer (@THS-on), Michael Peters (@mpeters), Marcio Silva (@maugustosilva)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/keylime/enhancements/issues/60

#### Remove requirement for atomic quotes and improve validation architecture

- Description: [Keylime](http://keylime.dev) enables users to monitor remote nodes (file integrity and measured boot) using a hardware based cryptographic root of trust. Keylime currently uses "Atomic Quotes" of PCRs from TPM security modules which can cause some extra churn in attestation and extra work for the TPM itself. These atomic quotes are not strictly necessary and removing them would help performance and scalability of the verification and also less work on the target agents.
- Recommended Skills: Python, Security, Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)
- Mentor(s): Thore Sommer (@THS-on), Michael Peters (@mpeters)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/keylime/enhancements/issues/59

#### Improved Web UI for Keylime

- Description: [Keylime](http://keylime.dev) enables users to monitor remote nodes (file integrity and measured boot) using a hardware based cryptographic root of trust. Most of the interactions with Keylime are via the CLI or REST APIs. There exists a bare bones web UI but it is limited in usability and usefulness. This task would be to overhaul and improve the UI to make it more usable and attractive.
- Recommended Skills: Python, Javascript, Web UIs
- Mentor(s): Michael Peters (@mpeters)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/keylime/enhancements/issues/61

#### Enhanced Event Logging

- Description: [Keylime](http://keylime.dev) enables users to monitor remote nodes (file integrity and measured boot) using a hardware based cryptographic root of trust. Various keylime components currently log events and information in a text log on the machine where the process is running. Not only does this make it challenging in a distributed environment, but it is also difficult to parse through the unstructured data looking for specific historical events. We would like to create structured events for every state change in keylime (new agent registered, agent passes attestation, agent fails attestation, etc) and send those to a 3rd party system like ElasticSearch. This will allow creating more detailed dashboards as well as historical event logs for forensic analysis.
- Recommended Skills: Python, ElasticSearch
- Mentor(s): Michael Peters (@mpeters)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/keylime/enhancements/issues/62

### Cluster API Provider AWS

#### Improve observability of CAPA

- Description: Cluster API Provider AWS (CAPA) is a subproject of SIG Cluster Lifecycle that extends Cluster API to simplify lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters on AWS. The focus of this project is to improve the observability of CAPA by integrating it with observability tools such as OpenTelemetry/Jaeger/Prometheus. With the help of metrics/traces emitted by these observability integrations, users will easily analyze CAPA's behaviour and performance.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, observability tools (such as OpenTelemetry/Jaeger/Prometheus)
- Mentor(s): Sedef Savas (@sedefsavas) Richard Case (@richcase)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/issues/2178

### Prometheus

#### Add Rule-Length-Encoding as TSDB encoding

- Description: Prometheus stores the scraped data in it's own [Time Series Database](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Time_series_database) (TSDB). Due to the nature of often collecting simliar values they can be stored in sequenence using optimized encodings. In Prometheus v2.0 and above all values are encoded using [XOR'ed](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/03/gorilla-a-fast-scalable-in-memory-time-series-database/) int64. Almost since the initial v2.0 release there is a long standing issue on adding other encodings to Prometheus' TSDB. Especially cases where either all values of the series are either `0` or `1` are prime candidates for [Run-Length-Encoding](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Run-length_encoding) (RLE). After conducting an [experiment on the real world feasbility for adding RLE](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/10275), that looks very promising (saving up to 10% disk), we want to work with you to improve Prometheus' storage!
- Recommended Skills: Golang

- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/5865
### Thanos

#### Consistent Hashing in Thanos Receive Hashrings
- Description: The current implementation of the Thanos Receive uses non-consistent hashing to distribute metrics across distributed ingesting replicas. The scalability that this enables can be improved. Because the hash is not consistent, every change in number or replicas considered for metric distribution can cause larger memory utilization for short periods. In the past, we tried to mitigate this problem by flushing the replica content to object storage which caused delays in scale-out and down. Switching to consistent hash implementation like a hash ring would allow us to mitigate this issue without delaying the scaling process. This should improve the life of Thanos receive users by enabling easier auto-scaling capabilities for production systems that have to react to different metric consumption characteristics. Join us in the effort of moving the hashing method to a consistent one!

#### Compaction/Downsampling: build chunks from object storage without touching disks
- Description: Right now during the compaction/downsampling stage, the Thanos Compactor always
downloads TSDB blocks to local disk first and compacts/downsamples them later. This download process
takes a long time if the data is large. Actually it is doable to read the data we need from the
object storage directly and perform the action on the fly. This improvement will help save a lot
of disk space in larger deployment.

### Service Mesh Performance

#### CNCF Cluster: Performance Benchmarking

- Description: [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io) Service Mesh Performance is a standard for capturing and characterizing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata. Service Mesh Performance test results capture rich performance profiles and realtime statistical analysis of microservices. There is a need of a dashboard of these results in which all service mesh projects are representeed, analyzed and charted visually in order to give better insight as to the performance characaterstics and value povided by cloud native infrastructure.

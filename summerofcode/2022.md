#### Supporting KubeArmor for ARM platforms

- Description: KubeArmor has garnered interests from edge computing platforms (such as LF Edge OpenHorizon) that leverage k8s control plane for workload orchestration. The primary requirement is to support ARM platforms that are prevalent on the edge devices (especially Raspberry PI).
- Recommended Skills: golang, raspberry-pi, ebpf, k8s

- Mentor(s): Hongcai Ren (@RainbowMango)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/karmada-io/website/issues/14

### Pixie

#### Augment Pixie Metadata Context

- Description: Pixie helps contextualize the data it collects by joining it with the relevant K8s metadata. This helps us answer questions like “Pod A has a HTTP request latency of 30ms” and allows us to build resource-level visualizations. Currently, Pixie pulls in metadata about namespaces, pods, and services, but is currently missing other useful K8s resources. You can help add resources to Pixie’s metadata context and experiment with what views and dashboards can leverage this new metadata.
- Recommended Skills: Go, C++
- Mentor(s): Michelle Nguyen (@aimichelle)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/34

#### TrafficNet & Protocol Inference Models

- Description: Pixie’s protocol tracer captures traffic for various protocols, including HTTP, gRPC, postgres and many more. The protocol tracer relies on protocol inference rules to classify traffic based on the contents of the messages being sent. To validate the accuracy of our protocol inference rules, we need a large database of different traffic patterns. We call this dataset TrafficNet. For this project, you will try to (1) expand the TrafficNet data set to include more samples of existing and new protocols, and (2) experiment with different inference models to improve the accuracy of the protocol inference.
- Recommended Skills: C++, Python
- Mentor(s): Omid Azizi (@oazizi000) 
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/404

#### Expand PxL Function Library

- Description: PxL is a Pandas-based query language which is used to query Pixie’s data. Help add to PxL’s function library to make it easier for users to transform their data and build interesting views. This may include adding math and string operations, or functions of your own choice. 
- Recommended Skills: C++
- Mentor(s): Natalie Serrino (@nserrino)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/405 https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/356 

### CoreDNS

#### Automatic Certificate Management in TLS plugin

- Description: [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is a cloud-native DNS server with a focus on service discovery. While best known as the default DNS server for Kubernetes, CoreDNS is capable of handle many other scenarios such as servering DNS through HTTPS/TLS. This project is to provide certificate management automation in TLS plugin.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, DNS, TLS, Certificate Management
- Mentor(s): Yong Tang (@yongtang) Paul Greenberg (@greenpau)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/3460

### TiKV

#### Latency Tracing
- Description: [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) is an open-source, distributed, and transactional key-value database. TiKV is widely used in many mission-critical scenarios that require request latency to be below a single millisecond level, so knowing where the latency has consumed is important. This project is going to let TiKV has the ability to observe the latency composition and diagnose slow requests.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, OpenTracing
- Mentor(s): Jay Lee (@BusyJay), breeswish (@breeswish)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11872

### Cross Cluster Replication
- Description: [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) is an open-source, distributed, and transactional key-value database. Cross Cluster Replication is an fundamental feature to provide the ability of cross region read replica and cross region disaster recovery. This project is going to build cross cluster replication ability of TiKV.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, Golang

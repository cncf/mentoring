### Attendance

* Nate W.
* Josh B.
* Vesyl

### Agenda

* LFX Mentorship
  * Term 2
    * Ending Aug 28, mentors and mentees should be thinking about how to finish up
  * Term 3
    * Applications closed, mentors making candidate selections
  * 2025 Term 1
    * We’re holding the [2024 term 1 umbrella issue](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/issues/1077) open still because we’ve not planned 2025 Term 1 yet. We should plan Term 1\.
  * \[NW\] Proof of work
    * Now that we’re able to monitor mentees productivity more closely, [https://mentorship-monitor-ui.netlify.app/](https://mentorship-monitor-ui.netlify.app/), I’d like to discuss the possibility of requiring proof of work in order for mentees to pass the evaluations.
    * Historically, the administrators have always deferred to the mentors
      * If the mentors say that the work submitted isn’t sufficient to pass the evaluation, the administrators could not overrule that, and I’d like to keep that part the same.
      * Moving forward, *I’d like the mentors and administrators to agree that the work is sufficient*. In most cases this is obvious, and if the mentors say the work is good it is; however, in some cases we see that some mentors have said the work is good but the public record appears to show a lack of progress. This can be due to several factors
        * Not all projects lend themselves to GitHub (for instance UI projects will often use Figma to do the work).
        * Some projects require a lot of research before changes can be made in GitHub

        If a mentor is able to explain this then I’m happy for the mentee to be passed, receive their stipend, and continue.

        What then would the criteria for disagreeing with the mentors be, and how could we override the mentors while preserving the trust of the maintainers?

* Revisit blog post requirements
  * \[NW\] We’ve discussed this before, but CNCF leadership has asked if we are requiring blog posts. I told them the reasons we don’t, but I’d like to revisit what recommendations we make around end of term blog posts and how we make them.
  * \[JB\] Need to provide a template \- currently folks write about the program, and a little about what they did. We’re interested in what they did primarily.
    * Video option?

### Notes

* NW to invite LFX team to meet with mentoring wg
* Clotributor chat: [https://clotributor.dev/](https://clotributor.dev/)

* We don’t want to mandate it to block the stipend payments
* We already have a few mentees every term writing blog posts
* Mentors/mentees might not have the skills
  * We would need to provide assistance, which might be hard due to resource constraints
  * We might provide a blogpost template, which might help with mentees to write the blog posts. This might help with having more blog posts.

  * Invite alumni to attend mentee info session
* \[aliok\] How to recruit more people to this WG?

## Communications

Please reach out to us using the [Discussions boards](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions).

We are also available on the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the admins a note via mentoring@cncf.io (please use the public channels for any project-related discussion).

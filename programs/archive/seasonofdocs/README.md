# Season of Docs

Google [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) gives technical writers an opportunity to work with open source projects.

## Post 2023

Beyond the 2023 cycle, the [Mentoring WG will no longer host Google Season of Docs](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/issues/1011) as it's not a mentorship program.

However, **GSoD is a great program**, and CNCF projects can still participate!

If your CNCF project would like help applying to GSoD, writing up a proposal, or would like a second set of eyes on a proposal, please open a [CNCF Service Desk ticket](https://servicedesk.cncf.io) or come find us in the [#techdocs](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CUJ6W5TLM) channel of the CNCF slack.

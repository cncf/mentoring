CNCF project maintainers interested in mentoring a technical writer have until **March 14th, 2023** to submit a [documentation proposal](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/org-proposal-template) for your CNCF project.

Well-scoped projects have:
- Clear scope: what will and won't a writer work on?
- Clear goals: when does the writer's work end?
- Clear metrics: how will you and the writer know you've succeeded?
- Clear budgeting: what are your project costs for a writer?

Complete your proposal by **March 14th, 2023.** Due to anticipated volume, projects submitted after March 14th may not be considered.

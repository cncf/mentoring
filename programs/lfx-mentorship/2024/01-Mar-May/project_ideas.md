## Proposed Project ideas

### Cilium

#### Governance Documentation

- Description: This project will focus on governance documentation for the Cilium project with two key parts. First, the governenace documentation should be moved out of the main docs and into the community repo. Second, we need to do an inventory of all of the repos under the project and come up with a lifecycle for them.
- Expected Outcome: Governance docs in community repo. All repos accounted for and with a lifecycle plan.
- Recommended Skills: enthusiasm for governance and basic markdown experience

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger-V2 Storage Backends

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently only memory storage is wired in v2, we need to add Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Cassandra, Badger.
- Expected Outcome: Build out full support in jaeger-v2 for all storage backends supported by jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/5084

#### Jaeger-V2 Observability

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently jaeger-v2 components are initialized without observability clients. We need to instantiate appropriate logging, tracing, and metrics clients and pass them to the components. The existing code uses internal metrics API, which needs to be bridged to OTEL metrics to minimize code changes.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity in observability of jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

#### Jaeger-V2 Adaptive Sampling

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Jaeger-v1 collector can serve sampling configuration to SDKs, and allows either static configuration (with hot reload) or adaptive sampling that continuously re-calculates the desired sampling probabilities. We need to enable all these capabilities in jaeger-v2.
- Expected Outcome: Support adaptive sampling in jaeger-v2
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

### Vitess

#### Improve Unit Test Coverage

- Description: Vitess is a scalable cloud-native database system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.The project is over 10 years old and there are parts of the code that don’t have very good unit test coverage. Revamping these code files and adding unit test coverage will help with the overall project health. Having strong unit testing is also useful in preventing introducing bugs when making code changes to these files. The task of the mentee would be to add said unit tests for the given code files. At the time of writing this proposal, the unit test coverage in Vitess stands at 47.3% of all lines of code.
- Expected Outcome: Improved unit test coverage in Vitess.
- Recommended Skills: Go, SQL, Unit testing

### Knative Eventing

#### Cross Namespace Event Links

- Description: One of the most requested features in Knative Eventing over the past few years has been for triggers in different namespaces than brokers, and for subscriptions
  in different namespaces than channels. More information can be found in the upstream issue.
- Expected Outcome: Knative Eventing Triggers and Subscriptions can reference Brokers or Channels in a namespace different from their own if the user possesses the necessary
  permissions to do so.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes

### Antrea

#### East-west connectivity monitoring tool for Pod network

- Description: As a K8s network plugin (CNI plugin), Antrea provides networking functions for K8s Pods. These Pods are located on different Nodes, which can be in different availability zones, or even different geos. We would like to provide as part of Antrea (built-in capability) a tool to monitor Pod connectivity across the cluster. This tool should be able to report the average network latency between any 2 Nodes in the cluster. The latency information could then be visualized using a heatmap representation in the Antrea web UI.
- Expected Outcome: A new Antrea API which reports network health information and latency between K8s Nodes. If time allows, the Antrea web UI should also be extended so that latency information can be easily visualized through a heatmap.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, some basic networking knowledge (TCP/IP stack), frontend development experience (React, TypeScript) would be great but not required.

- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/issues/5514

#### Ability to install / upgrade Antrea using the CLI

- Description: Currently Antrea can be installed using a K8s YAML manifest or through the provided Helm chart. We believe there is value in providing a 3rd installation method, using the "antctl" CLI. The CLI installation / upgrade method would have the following advantages: a) more user-friendly, with support for command-line options to customize the installation, b) ability to run sanity checks on the K8s cluster before comitting to the installation, c) when upgrading, the CLI will ensure that Antrea components are upgraded in the optimal order, to minimize workload disruption.
- Expected Outcome: A new command for antctl, the Antrea CLI, which will provide support for installation and upgrade.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, UX experience would be great but not required.

#### Replace deprecated bincover with golang built-in coverage profiling tool

- Description: Currently Antrea uses a third-party tool called [bincover](https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover) to measure code coverage when running end-to-end (e2e) tests. This tool has been deprecated in favor of the built-in Go coverage profiling tool (https://go.dev/testing/coverage/) starting with Go 1.20, and it is no longer maintained. We would like to remove usage of bincover from the Antrea project and start using the built-in Go tool.
- Expected Outcome: Complete removal of the bincove dependency. Code coverage can still be measured with the same accuracy when running Antrea e2e tests and the results can still be reported to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/).
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang and the Golang testing framework.

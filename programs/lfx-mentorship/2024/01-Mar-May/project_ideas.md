## Proposed Project ideas

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger-V2 Storage Backends

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently only memory storage is wired in v2, we need to add Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Cassandra, Badger.
- Expected Outcome: Build out full support in jaeger-v2 for all storage backends supported by jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD
- Mentor(s):
  - Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro, github@ysh.us)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/5084

#### Jaeger-V2 Observability

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently jaeger-v2 components are initialized without observability clients. We need to instantiate appropriate logging, tracing, and metrics clients and pass them to the components. The existing code uses internal metrics API, which needs to be bridged to OTEL metrics to minimize code changes.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity in observability of jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

#### Jaeger-V2 Adaptive Sampling

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Jaeger-v1 collector can serve sampling configuration to SDKs, and allows either static configuration (with hot reload) or adaptive sampling that continuously re-calculates the desired sampling probabilities. We need to enable all these capabilities in jaeger-v2.
- Expected Outcome: Support adaptive sampling in jaeger-v2
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

## Proposed Project ideas

### Cilium

#### Governance Documentation

- Description: This project will focus on governance documentation for the Cilium project with two key parts. First, the governenace documentation should be moved out of the main docs and into the community repo. Second, we need to do an inventory of all of the repos under the project and come up with a lifecycle for them.
- Expected Outcome: Governance docs in community repo. All repos accounted for and with a lifecycle plan.
- Recommended Skills: enthusiasm for governance and basic markdown experience

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger-V2 Storage Backends

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently only memory storage is wired in v2, we need to add Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Cassandra, Badger.
- Expected Outcome: Build out full support in jaeger-v2 for all storage backends supported by jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD
- Mentor(s):
  - Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro, github@ysh.us)
  - Jonah Kowall (@jkowall, jkowall@kowall.net)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/5084

#### Jaeger-V2 Observability

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently jaeger-v2 components are initialized without observability clients. We need to instantiate appropriate logging, tracing, and metrics clients and pass them to the components. The existing code uses internal metrics API, which needs to be bridged to OTEL metrics to minimize code changes.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity in observability of jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

#### Jaeger-V2 Adaptive Sampling

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Jaeger-v1 collector can serve sampling configuration to SDKs, and allows either static configuration (with hot reload) or adaptive sampling that continuously re-calculates the desired sampling probabilities. We need to enable all these capabilities in jaeger-v2.
- Expected Outcome: Support adaptive sampling in jaeger-v2
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

### Vitess

#### Improve Unit Test Coverage

- Description: Vitess is a scalable cloud-native database system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.The project is over 10 years old and there are parts of the code that don’t have very good unit test coverage. Revamping these code files and adding unit test coverage will help with the overall project health. Having strong unit testing is also useful in preventing introducing bugs when making code changes to these files. The task of the mentee would be to add said unit tests for the given code files. At the time of writing this proposal, the unit test coverage in Vitess stands at 47.3% of all lines of code.
- Expected Outcome: Improved unit test coverage in Vitess.
- Recommended Skills: Go, SQL, Unit testing

### Knative Eventing

#### Cross Namespace Event Links

- Description: One of the most requested features in Knative Eventing over the past few years has been for triggers in different namespaces than brokers, and for subscriptions
  in different namespaces than channels. More information can be found in the upstream issue.
- Expected Outcome: Knative Eventing Triggers and Subscriptions can reference Brokers or Channels in a namespace different from their own if the user possesses the necessary
  permissions to do so.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes

### Kyverno

#### Kyverno for Envoy Authorization

- Description: Build an Envoy plugin to support authorisation based on Kyverno policies.
- Expected Outcome: Enable users to perform autorisation with similar concepts as kyverno and kyverno-JSON using policies.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Envoy
- Mentor(s):
  - Charles-Edouard Brétéché (@eddycharly, charles.edouard@nirmata.com)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/issues/9488

#### Kyverno VPA Recommender 

- Description: A common pain-point heard from users is improper resource allocations, and if Kyverno policies can help with that. This is an exploratory project to see if Kyverno can work with Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscalers (VPA).
- Expected Outcome: Kyverno policies that work with VPA recommender.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes

- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/issues/9429


#### Convert Kubernetes Best Practices Policies to CEL 

- Description: Kubernetes Best Practices policies are written using Kyverno patterns and JMESPath, which means they cannot be executed as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy resources in the API server. This project aims to convert Kubernetes Best Practices policies, and other validating policies, to CEL wherever possible.
- Expected Outcome: Convert Kyverno policies for Kubernetes best practices to CEL.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Kyverno policies, CEL

#### Kyverno OpenVEX Integration

- Description: Currently one cannot use the payload in an attestation and use it while verifying a different signed attestation through Kyverno image verification policy.
- Expected Outcome: Support condition validation across multiple image verification attestations or context entry.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, VEX, Cosign, Notary

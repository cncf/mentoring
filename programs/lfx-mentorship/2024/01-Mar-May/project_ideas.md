## Proposed Project ideas

### CRI-O

#### Fully Automated CRI-O Releases

- Description: There are several steps to the CRI-O release process that are manual. Lots of work has been done to update this, but there is still pushing a tag, copying release notes and some other small tasks. This project is about such automation.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Fully automated release and patch versions of CRI-O

### Antrea

#### East-west connectivity monitoring tool for Pod network

- Description: As a K8s network plugin (CNI plugin), Antrea provides networking functions for K8s Pods. These Pods are located on different Nodes, which can be in different availability zones, or even different geos. We would like to provide as part of Antrea (built-in capability) a tool to monitor Pod connectivity across the cluster. This tool should be able to report the average network latency between any 2 Nodes in the cluster. The latency information could then be visualized using a heatmap representation in the Antrea web UI.
- Expected Outcome: A new Antrea API which reports network health information and latency between K8s Nodes. If time allows, the Antrea web UI should also be extended so that latency information can be easily visualized through a heatmap.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, some basic networking knowledge (TCP/IP stack), frontend development experience (React, TypeScript) would be great but not required.

#### Ability to install / upgrade Antrea using the CLI

- Description: Currently Antrea can be installed using a K8s YAML manifest or through the provided Helm chart. We believe there is value in providing a 3rd installation method, using the "antctl" CLI. The CLI installation / upgrade method would have the following advantages: a) more user-friendly, with support for command-line options to customize the installation, b) ability to run sanity checks on the K8s cluster before comitting to the installation, c) when upgrading, the CLI will ensure that Antrea components are upgraded in the optimal order, to minimize workload disruption.
- Expected Outcome: A new command for antctl, the Antrea CLI, which will provide support for installation and upgrade.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, UX experience would be great but not required.

#### Replace deprecated bincover with golang built-in coverage profiling tool

- Description: Currently Antrea uses a third-party tool called [bincover](https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover) to measure code coverage when running end-to-end (e2e) tests. This tool has been deprecated in favor of the built-in Go coverage profiling tool (https://go.dev/testing/coverage/) starting with Go 1.20, and it is no longer maintained. We would like to remove usage of bincover from the Antrea project and start using the built-in Go tool.
- Expected Outcome: Complete removal of the bincove dependency. Code coverage can still be measured with the same accuracy when running Antrea e2e tests and the results can still be reported to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/).
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang and the Golang testing framework.

### Chaos Mesh

#### Observability for StressChaos

- Description: StressChaos is a chaos experiment that injects stress to the system. The current implementation of StressChaos is lack of observability, most of observability solutions could not observe the stress at Pod level, but only at Node level. This project is to enhance observability for StressChaos.
- Expected Outcome: Chaos Mesh end users could observe the injected stress at Pod level.

### Harbor

#### Harbor CLI

- Description: Harbor is a popular and widely adopted container registry. We have developed an initial CLI (https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli) that we would like to extend and implement additional functionality, and common workflows that are currently only present in the Web UI. We are seeking a Golangs experienced manatee who can work on the project independently. 
- Expected Outcome: Working Golang Harbor CLI which can be used in the CI/CD implementations that compliment the Web UI covering the typical workflows of Harbor administrators and users.

#### Harbor Satellite

- Description: Containers are becoming more and more omnipresent, event outside their natural habitat, the cloud. It is not common today to see that container are running on small and remote devices on the EDGE. Those fleets of devices often donâ€™t have a reliable internet connection or no internet connection at all. Running containers without being able to fetch images is a hard thing to do. So we are bringing the registry closer to the appliances where they are running.
Since we are not talking about a few registries but many more, it becomes challenging to manage all the registries, this is where the satellite concept comes into place where images are distributes from a central registry.
The following slides and video outline the concept and its purpose in more detail.

- Expected Outcome: The goal is to create a proof of concept, showcasing that such a solution practically works. Candidates should be able to demonstrate, how images can be replicated from a central registry to a registry on the edge location.
The demonstration should contain a tunneling solution that has a Golang SDK or can be controlled from a Golang application. Part of the project is the selection and evaluation of different tunneling solutions. 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, OSS contributions, distributed systems

#### Testing framework for image-based gadgets

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux hosts. Previously, Inspektor Gadget had a set of built-in gadgets. We are now moving to image-based gadgets where users can develop their own gadgets in eBPF and host them in OCI registries. But we don't have a test framework to help gadget authors to test their gadgets. This project will focus on implementing such a framework, possibly taking inspiration from the existing framework for built-in gadgets. The documentation for gadget authors should be updated. This project has the opportunity to expand beyond testing, to work on the gadget development experience over all, for example by creating a github template for gadget development.
- Expected Outcome: Gadget authors can test their gadgets
- Recommended Skills: Go, containers, Linux, testing

#### Move2Kube: Simplify plugin architecture of m2k

- Description: Move2Kube is a command-line tool for automating creation of Infrastructure as code (IaC) artifacts. The tool has a powerful plugin based transformer architecture where developers can write their own custom transformer plugins to fulfil their re-platforming needs. However, concepts like path mappings etc could be simplified for better adoption. Example - writing a Move2Kube custom transformer needs developers to understand various concepts such as path mappings etc, can we reduce this learning overhead by simplifying the Move2Kube architecture?
- Expected Outcome:
  - Come up with a simplified alternative design for plugin architecture for M2K
  - Migrate existing components to support the new design with backward compatibility (good to have).
- Recommended Skills:

#### Keadm Tool Enhancement

- Description: Keadm(KubeEdge installation tool) now only supports configuring a subset of parameters during EdgeCore installation. We would like to support specifying parameters using `--set` or directly using an existing local configuration file to achieve full parameter configuration and meet the users' requirements. 
- Expected Outcome: Users can use `keadm join --set` or specify the local `edgecore.yaml` to configure EdgeCore.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, KubeEdge

### KubeVela

#### Support versioning for definitions

- Description: In KubeVela, X-Definitions provide the foundation for users to construct their applications. Currently we will automatically upgrade the definitions' version for our users, however, we still need the capability of explicit versioning in definitions. With this feature, our users can now manage the version easily for application upgrades and migrations.
- Expected Outcome: Support expilict versioning in definitions to help application upgrades and migrations.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes

#### Convert Kubernetes Best Practices Policies to CEL 

- Description: Kubernetes Best Practices policies are written using Kyverno patterns and JMESPath, which means they cannot be executed as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy resources in the API server. This project aims to convert Kubernetes Best Practices policies, and other validating policies, to CEL wherever possible.
- Expected Outcome: Convert Kyverno policies for Kubernetes best practices to CEL.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Kyverno policies, CEL

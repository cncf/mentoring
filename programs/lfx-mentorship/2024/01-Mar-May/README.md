### Antrea

#### East-west connectivity monitoring tool for Pod network

- Description: As a K8s network plugin (CNI plugin), Antrea provides networking functions for K8s Pods. These Pods are located on different Nodes, which can be in different availability zones, or even different geos. We would like to provide as part of Antrea (built-in capability) a tool to monitor Pod connectivity across the cluster. This tool should be able to report the average network latency between any 2 Nodes in the cluster. The latency information could then be visualized using a heatmap representation in the Antrea web UI.
- Expected Outcome: A new Antrea API which reports network health information and latency between K8s Nodes. If time allows, the Antrea web UI should also be extended so that latency information can be easily visualized through a heatmap.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, some basic networking knowledge (TCP/IP stack), frontend development experience (React, TypeScript) would be great but not required.

#### Ability to install / upgrade Antrea using the CLI

- Description: Currently Antrea can be installed using a K8s YAML manifest or through the provided Helm chart. We believe there is value in providing a 3rd installation method, using the "antctl" CLI. The CLI installation / upgrade method would have the following advantages: a) more user-friendly, with support for command-line options to customize the installation, b) ability to run sanity checks on the K8s cluster before comitting to the installation, c) when upgrading, the CLI will ensure that Antrea components are upgraded in the optimal order, to minimize workload disruption.
- Expected Outcome: A new command for antctl, the Antrea CLI, which will provide support for installation and upgrade.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, UX experience would be great but not required.

#### Replace deprecated bincover with golang built-in coverage profiling tool

- Description: Currently Antrea uses a third-party tool called [bincover](https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover) to measure code coverage when running end-to-end (e2e) tests. This tool has been deprecated in favor of the built-in Go coverage profiling tool (https://go.dev/testing/coverage/) starting with Go 1.20, and it is no longer maintained. We would like to remove usage of bincover from the Antrea project and start using the built-in Go tool.
- Expected Outcome: Complete removal of the bincove dependency. Code coverage can still be measured with the same accuracy when running Antrea e2e tests and the results can still be reported to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/).
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang and the Golang testing framework.

### CNCF TAG Network

#### Mapping Kubernetes Resources: Identifying relationships between all standard and custom resources

- Description: The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph.
- Expected Outcome:
  - YAML-formatted definition of one or more relationships per Kubernetes resource.
  - Documentation of each relationship - per component.
  - Development of new types of genealogies - new types of ways in which resources relate to one another and how these relationships might be visualized.
  - Verification of functional relationships
- Recommended Skills: DevOps, Kubernetes Administration, Light familiarity with all of the CNCF projects and a desire to study each project and their operators/resources.

### Chaos Mesh

#### Observability for StressChaos

- Description: StressChaos is a chaos experiment that injects stress to the system. The current implementation of StressChaos is lack of observability, most of observability solutions could not observe the stress at Pod level, but only at Node level. This project is to enhance observability for StressChaos.
- Expected Outcome: Chaos Mesh end users could observe the injected stress at Pod level.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Linux, Observability Tools(e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)

### Cilium

#### Governance Documentation

- Description: This project will focus on governance documentation for the Cilium project with two key parts. First, the governenace documentation should be moved out of the main docs and into the community repo. Second, we need to do an inventory of all of the repos under the project and come up with a lifecycle for them.
- Expected Outcome: Governance docs in community repo. All repos accounted for and with a lifecycle plan.
- Recommended Skills: enthusiasm for governance and basic markdown experience

### Cloud Native Buildpacks

#### Proof of concept for creating multi-arch images using buildkit

- Description: A proof of concept to add buildkit support to pack in order to build multi-arch images. Pack is the reference implementation of a Cloud Native Buildpacks platform used to build application images from source code.
- Expected Outcome: Multi-arch support has been one of the most requested features for Cloud Native Buildpacks, and this would allow end-users/developers to build multi-arch images with the pack cli.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Software development literacy, Familiarity building multi-arch containers with Docker and Buildkit. Familiarity with buildpacks will be helpful.

### CRI-O

#### Fully Automated CRI-O Releases

- Description: There are several steps to the CRI-O release process that are manual. Lots of work has been done to update this, but there is still pushing a tag, copying release notes and some other small tasks. This project is about such automation.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Fully automated release and patch versions of CRI-O
- Mentor(s):
    - Sascha Grunert (@saschagrunert, sgrunert@redhat.com)

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/7ed311c5-6b9b-4056-a8ee-acf04b9f55b9

### Flux

#### Conformance tests for AWS

- Description: Flux has several integration points with hyper-scaler platforms e.g., AWS. In general it is tricky to test these satisfactorily, because it requires running in the platform and thereby incurring usage costs. GCP donate credits that are used to test there; and now the Flux project has been generously granted credits to use for testing in AWS, and we can create conformance tests for AWS specifically too.
- Expected outcome: A suite of conformance tests for AWS integrations in Flux.
- Recommended skills: AWS, Golang, GitHub Actions
- Mentor: Stefan Prodan (@stefanprodan, stefan.prodan@gmail.com)

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/61486d56-9b28-42db-9e61-7a74b846cc15

### Harbor

#### Harbor CLI

- Description: Harbor is a popular and widely adopted container registry. We have developed an initial CLI (https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli) that we would like to extend and implement additional functionality, and common workflows that are currently only present in the Web UI. We are seeking a Golangs experienced manatee who can work on the project independently. 
- Expected Outcome: Working Golang Harbor CLI which can be used in the CI/CD implementations that compliment the Web UI covering the typical workflows of Harbor administrators and users. Familiarity with Golang library spf13/cobra and REST/Open API. Well-documented CLI that users love to use, and with the corresponding architectural diagrams under the Harbor. Working CI/CD with GitHub actions that create multi architecture binaries and containers.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, spf13/cobra

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/8654848d-1233-4e9f-8ed6-559af0ea8298

#### Harbor Satellite

- Description: Containers are becoming more and more omnipresent, event outside their natural habitat, the cloud. It is not common today to see that container are running on small and remote devices on the EDGE. Those fleets of devices often don’t have a reliable internet connection or no internet connection at all. Running containers without being able to fetch images is a hard thing to do. So we are bringing the registry closer to the appliances where they are running.
Since we are not talking about a few registries but many more, it becomes challenging to manage all the registries, this is where the satellite concept comes into place where images are distributes from a central registry.
The following slides and video outline the concept and its purpose in more detail.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRfcwotFzUSmfmSOmRQccBdJuFUFtIxeFE4mB3L9NgnOBM5tBnCs6uYOzyfUCIpd5xiEueMA1RYTFML/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000
- Expected Outcome: The goal is to create a proof of concept, showcasing that such a solution practically works. Candidates should be able to demonstrate, how images can be replicated from a central registry to a registry on the edge location.
The demonstration should contain a tunneling solution that has a Golang SDK or can be controlled from a Golang application. Part of the project is the selection and evaluation of different tunneling solutions. 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, OSS contributions, distributed systems

### Inspektor Gadget

#### Support for new types of eBPF programs

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux hosts. Users can develop gadgets using different kinds of eBPF programs: kprobe, tracepoint, etc. This project will focus on adding support for more kinds of eBPF programs such as uprobes and ensuring the documentation is updated for each of them
- Expected Outcome: Inspektor Gadget has support for additional eBPF program kinds
- Recommended Skills: Go, containers, Linux, basics of eBPF

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/f016029e-f15f-4ee9-aaf5-5719bee72b59

#### Testing framework for image-based gadgets

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux hosts. Previously, Inspektor Gadget had a set of built-in gadgets. We are now moving to image-based gadgets where users can develop their own gadgets in eBPF and host them in OCI registries. But we don't have a test framework to help gadget authors to test their gadgets. This project will focus on implementing such a framework, possibly taking inspiration from the existing framework for built-in gadgets. The documentation for gadget authors should be updated. This project has the opportunity to expand beyond testing, to work on the gadget development experience over all, for example by creating a github template for gadget development.
- Expected Outcome: Gadget authors can test their gadgets
- Recommended Skills: Go, containers, Linux, testing

### Istio

#### Improve Test Coverage for Istio Ambient Mesh

- Description: Ambient mesh is now one of the biggest features in Istio, but it is in its early stage. We are in the process of improving the test coverage for Ambient Mesh in order to move it to Beta. Ztunnel works as shared data plane within a node, it subscribes to `Workload` and `Authorization` resources, both need to be well tested.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Enhanced UnitTest coverage for `Workload` and `Authorization` Delta xDS/Stow interface.
  - Enhanced integration tests for ztunnel Authorization Policy 
- Recommended Skills: Go, Istio Test Framework

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger-V2 Storage Backends

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently only memory storage is wired in v2, we need to add Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Cassandra, Badger.
- Expected Outcome: Build out full support in jaeger-v2 for all storage backends supported by jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

#### Jaeger-V2 Observability

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Currently jaeger-v2 components are initialized without observability clients. We need to instantiate appropriate logging, tracing, and metrics clients and pass them to the components. The existing code uses internal metrics API, which needs to be bridged to OTEL metrics to minimize code changes.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity in observability of jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

#### Jaeger-V2 Adaptive Sampling

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Jaeger-v1 collector can serve sampling configuration to SDKs, and allows either static configuration (with hot reload) or adaptive sampling that continuously re-calculates the desired sampling probabilities. We need to enable all these capabilities in jaeger-v2.
- Expected Outcome: Support adaptive sampling in jaeger-v2
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

### KCL

#### KCL Package Version Management

- Description: The KCL package management tool primarily handles the management of third-party KCL packages for the KCL project, which includes tasks such as uploading and downloading these packages. When adding third-party packages to the KCL project, it is important to adhere to version management strategies. This involves carefully selecting and downloading the appropriate version of a package, especially when different versions of the same package are available.
- Expected Outcome: Add version management to the KCL package management tool.

Client_golang promises full support for the 3 latests major Go versions, and for this task a lot of manual effort is executed by the community. Client_golang could receive several improvements around its CI/CD pipelines and automation:
  - Golang version upgrades requires autogenerating go files that Go Collector uses to collect Go runtime metrics.
  - Unit tests need to be run for the 3 latest Go versions, and running tests locally with different Go versions is hard at the moment. We can explore locally reproducible CI/CD.
  - The changelog of new releases still requires a lot of manual work, like going through commit history and hand-picking commits that need to be advertised. We want to explore automation around semantic conventional commits that allows Changelog/Release automation.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Shell, CI/CD

### Service Mesh Performance

#### Service Mesh Performance: Adaptive Load Control with Nighthawk

- Description: The adaptive load controller operates by iteratively running optimization routines to ascertain the maximum load a system can sustain. Typically, this maximum load is determined by the system's capacity to handle requests per second (rps). The metrics, such as CPU usage and latency, collected from the system under test (SUT) serve as constraints to assess whether the SUT can sustain the imposed load. However, it lacks comprehensive lifecycle management functionalities. This hinders its adoption and limits its potential for continuous performance monitoring and optimization.
- Expected outcome:
Implement mechanisms to trigger alerts and notifications based on performance thresholds or significant changes in key metrics.
Integrate Nighthawk testing with existing CI/CD pipelines for automated performance validation and optimization as part of the development and deployment process.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with Service Mesh, grpc, docker, kubernetes

#### Service Mesh Performance: Distributed Load Testing with Nighthawk

- Description: Many performance benchmarks are limited to single instance load generation (single pod load generator). This limits the amount of traffic that can be generated to the output of the single machine that the benchmark tool runs on in or out of a cluster. Overcoming this limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing. Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that arguably more accurately represent real-world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.
- Expected Outcome: Implementation of distributed load generation in Nighthawk. Integration of Nighthawk with relevant service mesh performance testing scenarios. Capability to invoke Nighthawk for distributed load testing through APIs and command-line interfaces. Implementation of reporting mechanisms for distributed load testing results.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with HTTP/HTTPS performance testing tools, Service Mesh, grpc, familiarity with containerization technologies, like Docker would be helpful.

### Vitess

#### Improve Unit Test Coverage

- Description: Vitess is a scalable cloud-native database system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.The project is over 10 years old and there are parts of the code that don’t have very good unit test coverage. Revamping these code files and adding unit test coverage will help with the overall project health. Having strong unit testing is also useful in preventing introducing bugs when making code changes to these files. The task of the mentee would be to add said unit tests for the given code files. At the time of writing this proposal, the unit test coverage in Vitess stands at 47.3% of all lines of code.
- Expected Outcome: Improved unit test coverage in Vitess.

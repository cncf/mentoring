## Proposed Project ideas

### Envoy Gateway

#### IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack Support

- Description: Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a standalone or Kubernetes-based application gateway. Gateway API resources are used to dynamically provision and configure the managed Envoy Proxies. Currently the implementation only supports Kubernetes clusters with IPv4 enabled, and not IPv6
- Expected Outcome: 
  The managed Envoy Proxy fleet can
  - Accept connections/listen on an interface that has an IPv6 address assigned to it
  - Can route to IPv6 pod endpoints/addresses
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with Kubernetes Networking

### Konveyor AI 

#### Intelli-j IDE plugin integration of analyzer-lsp for real time updates with Konveyor AI

- Description: Konveyor provides a unified experience of tools to help organizations modernize their applications at scale, transitioning them to Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. Recently the Konveyor community began the development of a Generative AI approach for application modernization called Konveyor-AI.  Konveyor AI accelerates application migration by discovering migration incidents in the source code and providing LLM-generated fixes in a diff view presentation. When proposed changes are accepted, it provides real-time updates on the number of incidents.  The presentation side for this work is currently serviced via an IDE extension for VSCode.  
We aim to expand Konveyor AI by developing an IntelliJ plugin. Our first step involves integrating the static code analysis tool, analyzer-lsp, into the IntelliJ plugin. We plan to create a common module for interaction with analyzer-lsp, which can be used in multiple IDE plugins, starting with VSCode and IntelliJ. Currently, the IntelliJ IDE uses the Konveyor CLI tool, Kantra, for analysis and transformation, but we need to replace Kantra with analyzer-lsp to optimize real-time updates.

- Expected Outcome:
Define and implement a new module or library to facilitate integration of analyzer-lsp into multiple IDEs.  We will start with VSCode and IntelliJ to begin.

- Recommended Skills: Typescript, Java, Basic software development skills (command line, git)

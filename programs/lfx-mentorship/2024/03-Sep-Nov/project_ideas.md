## Proposed Project ideas

### CNCF TAG Network

#### Interrelating Kubernetes Resources: Identifying relationships between all standard and custom resources

- Description: The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - YAML-formatted definition of one or more relationships per Kubernetes resource.
  - Documentation of each relationship - per component.
  - Development of new types of genealogies - new types of ways in which resources relate to one another and how these relationships might be visualized.
  - Verification of functional relationships
- Recommended Skills: DevOps, Kubernetes Administration, Light familiarity with all of the CNCF projects and a desire to study each project and their operators/resources.

#### CNCF Challenges: Technical Content Creation

- Description: On a periodic basis, the CNCF would like to present a public challenge to those that are interested in participating (e.g. “Challenge: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger”).

Your mission in this internship is technical content creation of said challenges through use of markdown, Meshery, and any number of other CNCF projects. Challenges will be created using the Meshery Playground and published (in what is potentially the CNCF Hub). They will be similar too, but slightly different from these [example tutorials](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials/).

Understand that your challenges will be promoted through CNCF channels, reviewed by various project maintainers, and that each challenger (participant) will receive a certain number of points, depending upon whether or not they successfully complete the challenges that you create and in what timeframe they complete those challenges (the faster, the more points). Your challenges will need to vary in level of difficulty. 

- Expected Outcome:
  - 5+ new challenges published
  - Challenges can contain more than one objective. Points are earned for each objective completed.
  - Bonus: Extend one or more of Meshery’s Learning Paths.

- Recommended Skills: written English, Kubernetes, DevOps, and familiarity with any number of other CNCF projects, like Prometheus, CoreDNS, Istio, Jaeger, Helm, Harbor, OPA, Rook, SPIFEE, Flux, Argo, Flux, Falco, etc., Jekyll, strong organizational skills

#### Cleanup policy - Add deletion propagation support

- Description: Support specifying the deletion propagation policy in cleanup policies and TTL-based cleanup.
- Expected Outcome:
1. Support specifying the deletion propagation policy in cleanup policies
2. Support specifying the deletion propagation policy with TTL-based cleanup
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes

#### Controller autogen - Implement new approach to autogen

- Description: Implement a new policy rules autogen system based on extracting the pod spec from higher-level controllers.
- Expected Outcome:
1. The new system works by applying the same rules on the extracted pod spec instead of generating new rules for higher-level controllers
2. The system treats pods and higher-level controllers exactly the same from a policy stand point
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes

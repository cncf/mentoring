## Proposed Project ideas

### Thanos

#### Add support for hedged requests

- Description: The long-tail requests sometimes are inevitable between the Thanos Store Gateway and an external cache. Lowering the timeouts between the store-gateway and the cache service isn't a greater way to address this problem. Using a HTTP client to issue hedged requests to object storage and other parts of Thanos' stack could help reduce tail latency by a lot.
- Expected Outcome: By the end of the term, the mentee will have a deeper knowledge of Thanos and have improved our HTTP request tail latencies considerably!
- Recommended Skills: Go, HTTP, Prometheus, Thanos

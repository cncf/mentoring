### Antrea

#### Support application-level DNS caches when using FQDN-based security rules

CNCF - Antrea: Application-Level DNS Caches for FQDN-Based Security Rules (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Antrea provides [Network Policy APIs](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/docs/antrea-network-policy.md) (in the form of K8s CRDs) for K8s cluster administrators and application developers to declare security rules in order to protect workloads. These APIs complement the [Network Policies supported natively in K8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/). When using the Antrea-specific Network Policy APIs, it is possible to use Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) in order to select the list of external domains with which a K8s application is allowed to communicate, or forbidden from communicating. The current implementation of this feature is not compatible with applications which directly cache the result of DNS queries. We have found that this type of caching is frequent for Java applications, which greatly impacts the usability of FQDN-based security rules. We believe that by defining a new configuration parameter for the Antrea implementation, we can bypass the issue and ensure that the feature can be used even with such applications, providing of course that the parameter is set correctly by users.
- Expected Outcome: Definition and implementation of a new configuration parameter (`minTLS`) for the Antrea Agent, which will ensure that FQDN-based security rules can be used even with application that cache DNS results. The implementation should come with a sufficient amount of tests (both unit tests and e2e tests), ensuring that the feature is working as expected.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, basic knowledge about networking in particular of the DNS protocol.

### CNCF TAG Network

#### Interrelating Kubernetes Resources: Identifying relationships between all standard and custom resources

CNCF - TAG Network: Relating Standard and Custom Kubernetes Resources (2024 Term 3)

- Description: The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - YAML-formatted definition of one or more relationships per Kubernetes resource.
  - Documentation of each relationship - per component.
  - Development of new types of genealogies - new types of ways in which resources relate to one another and how these relationships might be visualized.
  - Verification of functional relationships
- Recommended Skills: DevOps, Kubernetes Administration, Light familiarity with all of the CNCF projects and a desire to study each project and their operators/resources.

#### CNCF Challenges: Technical Content Creation

CNCF - TAG Network: CNCF Challenges: Technical Content Creation (2024 Term 3)

- Description: On a periodic basis, the CNCF would like to present a public challenge to those that are interested in participating (e.g. “Challenge: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger”).

Your mission in this internship is technical content creation of said challenges through use of markdown, Meshery, and any number of other CNCF projects. Challenges will be created using the Meshery Playground and published (in what is potentially the CNCF Hub). They will be similar too, but slightly different from these [example tutorials](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials/).

Understand that your challenges will be promoted through CNCF channels, reviewed by various project maintainers, and that each challenger (participant) will receive a certain number of points, depending upon whether or not they successfully complete the challenges that you create and in what timeframe they complete those challenges (the faster, the more points). Your challenges will need to vary in level of difficulty. 

- Expected Outcome:
  - 5+ new challenges published
  - Challenges can contain more than one objective. Points are earned for each objective completed.
  - Bonus: Extend one or more of Meshery’s Learning Paths.

- Recommended Skills: written English, Kubernetes, DevOps, and familiarity with any number of other CNCF projects, like Prometheus, CoreDNS, Istio, Jaeger, Helm, Harbor, OPA, Rook, SPIFEE, Flux, Argo, Flux, Falco, etc., Jekyll, strong organizational skills

CNCF - Envoy Gateway: IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack Support (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a standalone or Kubernetes-based application gateway. Gateway API resources are used to dynamically provision and configure the managed Envoy Proxies. Currently the implementation only supports Kubernetes clusters with IPv4 enabled, and not IPv6
- Expected Outcome:
  The managed Envoy Proxy fleet can
  - Accept connections/listen on an interface that has an IPv6 address assigned to it
  - Can route to IPv6 pod endpoints/addresses
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with Kubernetes Networking

### Harbor

#### Harbor CLI

CNCF - Harbor: Harbor CLI (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Harbor is a popular and widely adopted container registry. LFX manatees have developed an initial CLI (https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli) that we would like to extend and implement additional functionality, and common workflows that are currently only present in the Web UI. We are seeking a Golang experienced manatee who can work on the project independently.
- Expected Outcome: Working Golang Harbor CLI which can be used in the CI/CD implementations that compliment the Web UI covering the typical workflows of Harbor administrators and users. Familiarity with Golang library spf13/cobra and REST/Open API. Well-documented CLI that users love to use, and with the corresponding architectural diagrams under the Harbor. Working CI/CD with GitHub actions that create multi architecture binaries and containers.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, spf13/cobra

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/11beb7c5-02b3-4f33-9dc5-3480a43b0869

#### Harbor Satellite

- Description: Containers have extended beyond their traditional cloud environments, becoming increasingly prevalent in remote and edge computing contexts. These environments often lack reliable internet connectivity, posing significant challenges in managing and running containerized applications due to difficulties in fetching container images. To address this, the project aims to decentralize container registries, making them more accessible to edge devices.

- Expected Outcome:
  The goal is to extend the proof of concept 
  and demonstrate that such a solution practically works.
  Candidates should be able understanding and implementing the [image](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) and [distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
  to replicate images from a central registry to a registry on the edge location.

### Inspektor Gadget

#### New gadget for detecting deadlocks

CNCF - Inspektor Gadget: New gadget for detecting deadlocks (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux hosts. In this project, you will write a new gadget in BPF and WASM to detect deadlocks in applications. The BPF program will be attached on mutex locks and mutex unlocks functions with uprobes. The WASM program will build a mutex wait directed graph and look for cycles. Then, the gadget will display the stack trace showing the mutex locks causing the deadlock.

    This project builds upon previous work:

  - In a previous mentorship project, Inspektor Gadget gained support for uprobes and kernel stack traces (https://www.inspektor-gadget.io/blog/2024/06/supporting-uprobe-based-gadgets-lfx-mentorship-report/).
  - BCC tools include deadlock.py doing the same: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/deadlock_example.txt and https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/deadlock.py

    However, this project still has challenging issues to resolve:

  - Inspektor Gadget does not support dumping stack traces from userspace applications yet

- Expected Outcome: A new gadget detects lock order inversion and prints the stack traces where each mutex was acquired.

- Recommended Skills: Go, BPF, WASM, graph data structure

#### Testing Inspektor Gadget gadgets on different kernel versions

CNCF - Inspektor Gadget: Testing Inspektor Gadget gadgets on different kernel versions (2024 Term 3)

- Description: The Inspektor Gadget gadgets are heavily coupled to the kernel version as they need to access internal kernel data and use different eBPF features. One key feature for Inspektor Gadget is to hide all this complexity from its users: the gadgets should work the same regardless the kernel version they’re running in. To be sure our gadgets (and Inspektor Gadget too) are working fine, we need to run tests on different kernel versions we want to support.

    The purpose of this mentorship is to develop a framework that allows gadget developers to (1) implement unit tests for their gadgets (2) and run them on different kernel versions. A previous mentorship successfully implemented a framework for running integration tests (https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/pull/2607), now it’s time to extend that framework to allow running unit tests as well. Some preliminary investigation done in (https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/pull/2638) explored the possibility to use https://github.com/lmb/vimto, it seems it’s the right tool for the job.

Expected Outcome: Gadget developers have a way to run unit tests in different kernel versions for their gadgets in their CI platform

- Recommended Skills: Golang

#### Exploring Chaos Engineering with eBPF and Inspektor Gadget

CNCF - Inspektor Gadget: Exploring Chaos Engineering with eBPF and Inspektor Gadget (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production, ref. https://principlesofchaos.org/, i.e. to induce errors on a system and see how it behaves. eBPF can be used to induce such errors on a system, it can change the return value of a kernel function, drop or modify network packets, etc.

    The goal of this mentorship is to implement a set of gadgets for Inspektor Gadget that helps causing system chaos. These are some ideas of the gadgets that should be implemented:

  - DNS: Drop/modify/add latency DNS requests and/or responses based on
    - The container or process performing it
      - The target URL
      - The DNS server
    - TCP/UDP: Drop network packets based on
      - Destination / Source IPs
      - Originating or destination pod or process
    - Simulate system call failures based on
      - Container or process performing the syscall
      - Syscall

    The gadgets should expose metrics with the number of times it induced failures, and possibly also provide notifications when those errors were induced.

- Expected Outcome: A set of gadgets with the above functionality should be implemented and merged on the upstream Inspektor Gadget repository. Those gadgets should include documentation and tests.

- Recommended Skills: Golang, eBPF, networking protocols.

#### Develop DNS/HTTP event generation capabilities in Inspektor Gadget

CNCF - Inspektor Gadget: DNS/HTTP Event Generation Capabilities (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Inspektor Gadget enables users to inspect Linux containers and Kubernetes workloads, offering the powerful capability to monitor traffic for currently running applications. So far, gadgets can only passively monitor events, the ability to generate specific events would be a great addition to the existing features. For example, if users could trigger a DNS request from a specific pod or make an HTTP request to a particular endpoint, Inspektor Gadget could check if the request succeeded or not. Users would then be notified if there are errors/outages/problems in the cluster.

- Expected Outcome: As part of the mentorship, you will:

    1. Explore the best way to implement event generation, external program vs implementing it within Inspektor Gadget.
    2. Develop DNS/HTTP event generator and see how it works with gadgets.
    3. Use the event generation in our integration testing.

- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes and Understanding of DNS/HTTP protocols.

### Istio

#### Improve documentation build infrastructure

CNCF - Istio: Improve documentation build infrastructure (2024 Term 3)

- Description: The build infrastructure for istio.io currently carries a complete archived copy of the site for each release of Istio.  These archived versions should be separated to their own branch, with only the supported versions published.  We should also separate out content which is not version-specific (e.g. the home page, news and blogs) so that only the latest version of this content is visible online.
- Expected Outcome: Updated publishing infrastructure for istio.io which separates evergreen content (home page, blogs) with versioned content (documentation).  Drop-downs per docs page allow switching between the supported versions.  
- Recommended Skills: Systems engineering, scripting, programming (Go/Bash), Hugo templating

#### Implement new site search

CNCF - Istio: Implement new site search (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Up to four versions of Istio are supported at one time, and so the documentation for each must be available. Our current site search is outdated and needs to be replaced, so that the search content only exists in the site search, and only fresh content is available on google.com.
- Expected Outcome: Working site search on istio.io, which lets you search for content for the currently supported versions.
- Recommended Skills: Hugo, Systems engineering, scripting, programming (Bash/go), Hugo templating

CNCF - Konveyor AI: IntelliJ plugin for Real-Time Updates with analyzer-lsp (2024 Term 3)

- Description: Konveyor provides a unified experience of tools to help organizations modernize their applications at scale, transitioning them to Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. Recently the Konveyor community began the development of a Generative AI approach for application modernization called Konveyor-AI.  Konveyor AI accelerates application migration by discovering migration incidents in the source code and providing LLM-generated fixes in a diff view presentation. When proposed changes are accepted, it provides real-time updates on the number of incidents.  The presentation side for this work is currently serviced via an IDE extension for VSCode.
We aim to expand Konveyor AI by developing an IntelliJ plugin. Our first step involves integrating the static code analysis tool, analyzer-lsp, into the IntelliJ plugin. We plan to create a common module for interaction with analyzer-lsp, which can be used in multiple IDE plugins, starting with VSCode and IntelliJ. Currently, the IntelliJ IDE uses the Konveyor CLI tool, Kantra, for analysis and transformation, but we need to replace Kantra with analyzer-lsp to optimize real-time updates.

#### Game operation and maintenance API

CNCF - OpenKruise: Game operation and maintenance API (2024 Term 3)

- Description: kruise-game contains two CRDs GameServer and GameServerSet. Game servers can be managed by deploying or changing the corresponding CR. However, in actual production use, a release or operation and maintenance action is often a combination of a series of operations on CR. For example, set the GameServer image tag with ids 1, 7, and 10 to v0.3; adjust the update priority of GameServer with ids 5, 9, and 11 before updating the game server, etc. Therefore, a set of APIs with operation and maintenance semantics is needed, which users can directly use or integrate into their own operation and maintenance platform to facilitate operation and maintenance operations.
- Expected Outcome:
  * A service component that includes multiple APIs
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, RESTful API

### Crossplane

#### Make Crossplane Easy - Improving the Developer Experience

- Description: Crossplane is in use at scale in many production environments, but we get often get feedback that there are many obstacles to learn Crossplane and get to a successfully built production-ready control plane. A major reason for this learning curve is the lack of supporting tools and experiences on top of core Crossplane that could accelerate the communityâ€™s attempts to successfully build their platforms. These higher level experiences have recently become a focus for the project and we want to keep delivering awesome experiences that make Crossplane easier to use.
- Expected Outcome: We expect the mentee to design and code multiple improvements to the Crossplane tooling from the issue linked below. We will start with smaller scoped issues to ramp up and then focus on a bigger deliverable such as adding [validation for Crossplane Functions](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/issues/5094). By the end of the term, the mentee will have multiple code PRs merged into the Crossplane codebase.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes, Crossplane, CLI tools, passion for DevEx

### Harbor

#### Harbor CLI

- Description: Harbor is a popular and widely adopted container registry. We have developed an initial CLI (https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli) that we would like to extend and implement additional functionality, and common workflows that are currently only present in the Web UI. We are seeking a Golangs experienced manatee who can work on the project independently.
- Expected Outcome: Working Golang Harbor CLI which can be used in the CI/CD implementations that compliment the Web UI covering the typical workflows of Harbor administrators and users. Familiarity with Golang library spf13/cobra and REST/Open API. Well-documented CLI that users love to use, and with the corresponding architectural diagrams under the Harbor. Working CI/CD with GitHub actions that create multi architecture binaries and containers.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, spf13/cobra

#### Harbor Satellite

- Description: In recent years, containers have extended beyond their traditional cloud environments, becoming increasingly prevalent in remote and edge computing contexts. These environments often lack reliable internet connectivity, posing significant challenges in managing and running containerized applications due to difficulties in fetching container images. To address this, the project aims to decentralize container registries, making them more accessible to edge devices. The need for a satellite that can operate independently, store images on disk, and run indefinitely with stored data is crucial for maintaining operations in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.
  Harbor Satellite aims to bring Harbor container registries to edge locations, ensuring consistent, available, and integrity-checked images for edge computing environments. This proposal outlines the development of a stateful, standalone satellite that can function as a primary registry for edge locations and as a fallback option if the central Harbor registry is unavailable.
- Expected Outcome:
  The goal is to extend the proof of concept
  and demonstrate that such a solution practically works.
  Candidates should be able understanding and implementing the [image](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) and [distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
  to replicate images from a central registry to a registry on the edge location.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Container, Image-spec, Distribution-spec

### in-toto

### Add GUAC support

- Description: The project aims to integrate Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) with in-toto, a framework safeguarding software supply chain integrity. [Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC)](https://guac.sh/) aggregates software security metadata into a high fidelity graph databaseâ€”normalizing entity identities and mapping standard relationships between them. This project seeks to extend in-toto's capabilities by incorporating GUAC, enabling users to query GUAC with Package URLs (purls) and retrieve pertinent attestations.
- Expected Outcome: Adds functionality to query GUAC, retrieve and parse relevant attestations for the specified artifact.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Python
- Mentor(s):

#### Documentation Boost!

- Description:
    - Help contributors get started with improving the documentation of CNCF projects and TAGs.  To start, we'd like mentees to help to
      improve both the documentation of a project, and also encourage them to contribute to other projects.  So, view the issues as a starting
      point to help start your career in open source.
- Expected Outcome:
    - Develop effective documentation for CNCF projects.  As a start, the CNCF project in-toto has a fairly clear set of requirements for what
      documentation changes are needed.
- Recommended Skills:
    - Technical writing
    - Basic understanding of cloud native projects (or a desire to learn!)

#### Sigstore support for in-toto-jenkins

- Description: The [in-toto Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-jenkins-plugin) allows users to generate metadata in their build pipelines. Currently keys or credentials must be provided to the plugin to sign the metadata, whereas Sigstore offers keyless signing and verification. The addition of Sigstore transport will allow seamless uploading of metadata to Rekor transparency log. This project aims to enhance the Jenkins plugin by adding [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev) support, allowing keyless signing and adding Sigstore transport.
- Expected Outcome: in-toto-jenkins plugins gets support for Sigstore
- Recommended Skills: Java, Jenkins

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger-V2 Observability and Healthchecks

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. (1) Currently jaeger-v2 components are initialized without observability clients. We need to instantiate appropriate logging, tracing, and metrics clients and pass them to the components. The existing code uses internal metrics API, which needs to be bridged to OTEL metrics to minimize code changes. (2) Jaeger-v1 components can report their readiness using an internal health check API that is connected to the healthcheck endpoint on the admin port. We need to implement similar capability in Jaeger-v2.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity in observability of jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD
- Mentor(s):
    - Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro, github@ysh.us)
    - Jonah Kowall (@jkowall, jkowall@kowall.net)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/5240
- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/bd752f55-9080-4826-af09-ad86d3614ab2

#### Jaeger-V2 Service Performance Monitoring

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Jaeger-v1 implements a functionality known as [SPM](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/spm/), but it requires a separately running OpenTelemetry Collector to produce metrics out of spans using [SpanMetrics Connector](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/connector/spanmetricsconnector#section-readme). Since Jaeger-v2 is built on top of OTEL Collector, we can run SpanMetrics Connector directly in the Jaeger binary and simplify the setup for the users.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity in SPM of jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1. Implement integration tests. Update documentation accordingly.
    - Extra credit: implement metrics reader directly on top of Elasticsearch/Opensearch and bypass the need for Prometheus.
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

#### Jaeger-V2 Kafka-based architecture

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. Jaeger V2 is a major new version where we rebase all Jaeger backend components (agent, collector, ingester, and query) on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. The goal is to implement a deployment mode (supported in Jaeger-v1) that uses Kafka as an intermediate buffer for spans between collector and ingester. It should use the latest version of ibm/sarama driver ([related issue](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4591)) and support both original Jaeger formats as well as OpenTelemetry OTLP. It may be possible to utilize the Kafka exporter/receiver from OTEL contrib.
- Expected Outcome: Achieve parity for Kafka-based deployment jaeger-v2 compared to jaeger-v1, including internal observability. Implement integration tests. Update documentation accordingly.
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD

### Karmada

#### Certificate Lifecycle Management

- Description: The Karmada Certificate Lifecycle Management project addresses user challenges in certificate management, focusing on mitigating service disruptions and security risks due to expirations. Key goals include implementing a feature for real-time monitoring of certificates with advance notification for upcoming expirations; creating a comprehensive manual for manual replacement with best practices and visuals; allowing configurable certificate validity during deployment via CLI, Helm charts, and Operator; and designing an automated certificate rotation system to streamline certificate maintenance and ensure continuous security across Karmada environments.
- Expected Outcome: Certificate Visibility Tool/Feature, Manual Certificate Replacement Guide, Updated Installation Tools with Customizable Certificate Validity, and Automated Certificate Rotation Solution Design or Integration
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes Admin, certificate management, Helm.

### KCL

#### KCL Package Management Dependencies Sparse Checkout

- Description: `kpm` is a package management tool for KCL. When the scale of KCL project becomes larger and larger, and the external packages that KCL project relies on become more and more, `kpm` will become slow due to the need to download a large number of third-party dependencies. `kpm` needs to support `Sparse-Checkout`, which means downloading specific dependencies as needed rather than all of them, to improve the performance of the kpm.
- Expected Outcome: When kpm requests dependencies, it can request specific content based on the actual use of the required dependencies, but not all of them.
- Recommended Skills: golang, rust

#### Supports tree-sitter for KCL

- Description: Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. In order to support more features of the IDE, we need a more complete syntax tree, and for easy integration with the community, we intend to use tree-sitter to build a more complete parser system for KCL.

- Expected Outcome: Supports all of the current KCL syntax, which can pass all test cases.
- Recommended Skills: rust, LSP

### Knative

#### Improve Knative Eventing Onboarding

- Description:
  Onboarding new end users into a sophisticated system like Knative Eventing presents significant challenges, especially as it involves understanding not only the operational components but also a distinct architectural style - event driven architecture (EDA). These issues are also seen in the current documentation which is often too technical and not geared towards practical guidance.  This project seeks to perform a thorough investigation into the barriers that prevent smooth user onboarding and sustained engagement. By identifying these obstacles and developing clearer, more actionable onboarding materials, we aim to enhance the ease of entry and ongoing use of Knative Eventing for all users.

- Expected Outcome:
1. Produce a detailed report based on user research that outlines the current onboarding experience for new users of Knative Eventing. This report will highlight key barriers and challenges in the documentation and setup process, and recommend actionable improvements to make the onboarding process more user-friendly and less technically daunting.

2. Implement the proposed changes within the Knative community by developing comprehensive onboarding materials and enhancing existing documentation to better support new users.

- Recommended Skills: User Research, Communication, Technical Writing, Content Design

#### Knative - applying pre-prepared website design

- Description: Current design of the Knative website (https://knative.dev) does not look modern and contains inconsistent style. Knative UX working group has prepared a new design for the website. We would like to get this design implemented on the website. We also want to ensure with this implementation that the figures in the website include alt text descriptions. We are not looking for full WCAG compliance though.Also, currently the website is not really responsive and doesnâ€™t look good on a mobile device. The group also has a design for the mobile. Finally we have many diagrams on the website that have different styles. We would like to have these diagrams more cohesive. This part is an extended goal though.

- Expected Outcome: New design applied to website; website is made responsive; diagrams look and feel more cohesive.

- Recommended Skills: HTML, CSS, Markdown, SVG, Material for Mkdocs, Figma

### KubeArmor

#### Improve System Test Coverage and Pratices for KubeArmor

- Description: KubeArmor supports securing many environments ranging from Kubernetes, unorchestrated containers, bare metal and virtual machines. Our testing matrix however doesn't cover many of these completely. In this project, we plan to improve this coverage by introducing automated testing of some of these environments and imrove the scenarios covered in some existing ones. These tests would be written using the Ginkgo framework and automated via GitHub workflows. The matrix we'll target can be found in the upstream issue.
- Expected Outcome: Improved test coverage; Standards for writing tests for KubeArmor; Stabilization of KubeArmor
- Recommended Skills: Go, Scripting, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

#### Router Manager Support HA

- Description: Users need to communicate between the cloud and the edge. For example, the cloud calls the rest interface of the edge service. In this case, the routing management function of KubeEdge can be used. Currently, routing management function of KubeEdge has some problems in the case of multiple CloudCore copies. The main problem is that when there are multiple copies of CloudCore, whether the cloud sends messages to the edge or reports the message to the cloud, it is not known which CloudCore is sent to it for processing, and there is confusion in message management in the cloud. In this project, we hope router manager can be optimized to support multi-CloudCore scenario.
- Expected Outcome: Support using router manager in multi-CloudCore scenario.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, KubeEdge

### Kubernetes

#### Update Image Signing to Meet New Infra Requirements

- Description: The process that signs with Sigstore all container images released on community
  infra was designed for a different serving architecture. When the community
  moved to [registry.k8s.io](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/28/registry-k8s-io-faster-cheaper-ga/)
  and increased 10x the number of registries, the replication of signatures broke
  due to rate limits imposed on the new registries. As part of the project, you will
  be instrumental in implementing the new signing process currently being designed
  by the Kubernetes Release Engineering team. This project will involve heavy rewrites and
  refactoring of parts of the [Image Promoter](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/promo-tools),
  the tool that releases community images.
- Expected Outcome: Implementation of the new signing process, ideally we'll fix
  all inconsistent signatures across community registries.
- Recommended Skills: Go programming, strong container architecture and registry
  fundamentals, familiarity with [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/),
  [go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry) and infrastructure (GCP & AWS).

### Prometheus

#### Prometheus Remote Write Benchmarking Capabilities

- Description: Prometheus remote write allows users to send their metrics to other time series databases. Though the [Prombench tool](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/prombench) has existed for a number of years, it has never been extended to support performance testing of Remote Write in a realistic production like environment. With the upcomming Remote Write 2.0 changes to both the underlying implementation as well as the wire format, the need for benchmarking of remote write beyond static Go bechmark tests has increased.
- Expected Outcome: Build additional (or extends existing) tooling, similar to Prombenchâ€™s [load-generator](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/tools/load-generator) and [avalanche](https://github.com/prometheus-community/avalanche), to support scenarios under which remote write should be performance tested. For example; allowing gradual increases/decreases in # of active series, sudden spikes in active series, various amounts of latency in the server receiving the remote write data, etc. Time permitted, extend Prombench's test suite to include a set of Remote Write tests that can be run via a new command.
- Recommended Skills: Go, some familiarity with Prometheus or metrics, basic Docker knowledge

#### Mark Out-of-order ingestion as stable

- Description: Prometheus is known by not accepting out-of-order samples during ingestion, but recently (2 years ago) [support was added behind a feature-flag](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/11075). Since then, many improvements have been made to out-of-order ingestion and it has become one of the requirements for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We want to deliver Prometheus 3.0 in a few months, and that requires marking out-or-order ingestion as a stable feature. In this project we will clean up several smaller issues around out-of-order ingestion, hopefully marking it as stable by the end of the mentorship.
- Recommended Skills: Go, familiarity with Prometheus TSDB.

### Thanos

#### Compactor: Display TODO plan in UI

- Description: In the Thanos Compactor UI there is visibility of the global block list and loaded block list. But it would be useful to also have a list of planned and currently running compaction groups in order to see what exactly is in progress. This way it would be easier to diagnose what the Thanos Compactor is currently working on, and possibly what is delaying the progress of compactions. This is especially useful if you have large TSDB blocks in S3 buckets that take time to get compacted.
- Expected Outcome: We have an endpoint in Compactor that details compaction plan, and this is also visualized in a Compactor UI page.
- Recommended Skills: Go, React, some familiarity with Prometheus and Thanos

#### Enabling LLM fine tuning in the WASI-NN ggml plugin

- Description: WasmEdge is a lightweight and cross-platform runtime for LLM applications. It allows developers to create LLM apps on a Mac or Windows dev machine, compile them to Wasm, and deploy them on Nvidia machines without any changes to the binary app. It achieves application portability across CPUs and GPUs by supporting a W3C standard API called  [WASI-NN](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-wasi-nn), which abstracts GPU-related AI functions as high-level APIs. At this stage, however, only inference functions are supported. In this project, we aim to support fine-tuning features in WasmEdge. It will improve the developer experience for WasmEdge-enabled LLM tools. To achieve this, we plan to extend the current WASI-NN spec by adding a set of extra APIs, and then implement them by delegating to corresponding functions in llama.cpp embedded in the WasmEdge GGML plugin.
- Expected Outcome:
    - Use llama2-7b as the base LLM for fine-tuning; the final implementation should handle it correctly.
    - Extend the [WASI-NN](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-wasi-nn) spec if needed to support the fine-tuning feature.
    - Implement the fine-tuning functions inside [WASI-NN ggml plugin](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/plugins/wasi_nn/ggml.h). They will call the corresponding functions in llama.cpp, as the inference functions do.
    - Implement the LoRA-related functions inside the WASI-NN ggml plugin to load the pre-trained LoRA and verify the fine-tuned model.
    - Documentation, examples, tutorials, and demonstration are required.
- Recommended Skills: C++, WebAssembly, LLM fine-tuning

## Proposed Project ideas

---

#### Improve the website of our automated-benchmarking tool (migrate to shadcn ui and typescript)

- Description:
    - Vitess uses arewefastyet to automatically benchmark its codebase and ensure no performance regression is introduced. This tool benchmarks Vitess every day, and is used to visualize the results of those benchmarks. It is an important tool in the development cycle of Vitess and is used by its maintainers and adopters.
    - [Arewefastyet' website](https://benchmark.vitess.io) has changed quite a lot over the last year, we want to continue improving it by finishing the migration to TypeScript and by using Shadcn components.
    - Moreover, we want to make the website responsive and have a proper Figma that serves as a reference for current and future contributors.
- Expected Outcome:
    - The mentee is expected to produce a Figma with the design of the website that will be co-authored with the mentor.
    - Re-vamp most of the pages using Shadcn and the design defined with the mentor at the start of the internship period.
    - Add type information for all/most components using TypeScript.
- Recommended Skills:
    - Be skilled in React/Vite/TypeScript.
    - Must know how to simply use Docker and docker-compose.
    - Experience with Figma is a big plus.
    - Experience with Rest APIs and Golang is a plus too.

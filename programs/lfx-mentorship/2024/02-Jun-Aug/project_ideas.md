## Proposed Project ideas

### Thanos

#### Compactor: Display TODO plan in UI

- Description: In the Thanos Compactor UI there is visibility of the global block list and loaded block list. But it would be useful to also have a list of planned and currently running compaction groups in order to see what exactly is in progress. This way it would be easier to diagnose what the Thanos Compactor is currently working on, and possibly what is delaying the progress of compactions. This is especially useful if you have large TSDB blocks in S3 buckets that take time to get compacted.
- Expected Outcome: We have an endpoint in Compactor that details compaction plan, and this is also visualized in a Compactor UI page.
- Recommended Skills: Go, React, some familiarity with Prometheus and Thanos

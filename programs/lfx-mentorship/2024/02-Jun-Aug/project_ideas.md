## Proposed Project ideas

### CNCF TAG Network

#### Mapping CNCF Landscape one Relationship-at-a-time

- Description: While the OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes offer a taxonomy, integrating a graph data model with formalized ontologies unlocks a multitude of capabilities. Among these, enabling inferencing necessary for natural language processing stands out as a straightforward application. This, in turn, facilitates the possibility of a human-centric query/response interaction. Importantly, advancing to a knowledge semantic graph from a connected systems' graph data model opens the door to building more sophisticated systems.

- Expected Outcome: 
  - Identifying new technologies from CNCF landscape and creating new YAML-formatted definitions of one or more relationships.
  - Documentation of each relationship - per component.
  - Development of new types of genealogies - new types of ways in which resources relate to one another and how these relationships might be visualized.

- Recommended Skills: Familiarity with Helm charts and Artifact Hub, basic familiarity with Kubernetes, and familiarity with CNCF different projects would be helpful

#### Technical Content Creation: CNCF Challenges 

- Description: On a periodic basis, the CNCF would like to present a public challenge to those that are interested in participating (e.g. “Challenge: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger”). 

Your mission in this internship is technical content creation of said challenges through use of markdown, Meshery, and any number of other CNCF projects. Challenges will be created using the Meshery Playground and potentially published in the proposed CNCF Hub. They will be similar too, but slightly different from these [example tutorials](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials/).

Understand that your challenges will be promoted through CNCF channels, reviewed by various project maintainers, and that each challenger (participant) will receive a certain number of points, depending upon whether or not they successfully complete the challenges that you create and in what timeframe they complete those challenges (the faster, the more points). Your challenges will need to vary in level of difficulty. 

- Expected Outcome: 
  - 10+ new challenges published in CNCF Hub (and Meshery Catalog and Artifact Hub).
  - Challenges can contain more than one objective. Points are earned for each objective completed.
  - Bonus: Extend one or more of Meshery’s Learning Paths.
	
- Recommended Skills: written English, Kubernetes, DevOps, and familiarity with any number of other CNCF projects, like Prometheus, CoreDNS, Istio, Jaeger, Helm, Harbor, OPA, Rook, SPIFEE, Flux, Argo, Flux, Falco, etc., Jekyll, strong organizational skills

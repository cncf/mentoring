## Proposed Project ideas


### Cilium

#### Cilium Technical Outcomes

- Description: On the Cilium [homepage](cilium.io), we want to document technical outcomes from using Cilium. Think of these technical outcomes as aggregating some of cilium features to achieve a high level technical goal. These are the current ones we have in mind: Zero Trust Networking, Network Automation, Distributed Firewalling, Cost and Carbon Savings, Multi-cloud Connectivity.
- Expected Outcome: A section of the Cilium website detailing these technical outcomes. This section on the website can include any supporting materials from the Cilium community i.e blogs, videos, talks, illustrations, etc.
- Recommended Skills: Technical Writing, some basic working knowlegde of Cilium or the willingness to quickly ramp up, Kubernetes, general familiarity with the cloud native ecosystem, basic React.js(the cilium webiste is built with Gatsby).
- Mentor(s):
  - Paul Arah(paularah, <paul.arah@isovalent.com>)
  - Bill Mulligan(xmulligan, <bill.mulligan@isovalent.com>)

### Karmada

#### Certificate Lifecycle Management

- Description: The Karmada Certificate Lifecycle Management project addresses user challenges in certificate management, focusing on mitigating service disruptions and security risks due to expirations. Key goals include implementing a feature for real-time monitoring of certificates with advance notification for upcoming expirations; creating a comprehensive manual for manual replacement with best practices and visuals; allowing configurable certificate validity during deployment via CLI, Helm charts, and Operator; and designing an automated certificate rotation system to streamline certificate maintenance and ensure continuous security across Karmada environments.
- Expected Outcome: Certificate Visibility Tool/Feature, Manual Certificate Replacement Guide, Updated Installation Tools with Customizable Certificate Validity, and Automated Certificate Rotation Solution Design or Integration 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes Admin, certificate management, Helm.

### Knative

#### Improve Knative Eventing Onboarding

- Description:
Onboarding new end users into a sophisticated system like Knative Eventing presents significant challenges, especially as it involves understanding not only the operational components but also a distinct architectural style - event driven architecture (EDA). These issues are also seen in the current documentation which is often too technical and not geared towards practical guidance.  This project seeks to perform a thorough investigation into the barriers that prevent smooth user onboarding and sustained engagement. By identifying these obstacles and developing clearer, more actionable onboarding materials, we aim to enhance the ease of entry and ongoing use of Knative Eventing for all users.

- Expected Outcome:
1. Produce a detailed report based on user research that outlines the current onboarding experience for new users of Knative Eventing. This report will highlight key barriers and challenges in the documentation and setup process, and recommend actionable improvements to make the onboarding process more user-friendly and less technically daunting.

2. Implement the proposed changes within the Knative community by developing comprehensive onboarding materials and enhancing existing documentation to better support new users.

- Recommended Skills: User Research, Communication, Technical Writing, Content Design

### Prometheus

#### Prometheus Remote Write Benchmarking Capabilities

- Description: Prometheus remote write allows users to send their metrics to other time series databases. Though the [Prombench tool](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/prombench) has existed for a number of years, it has never been extended to support performance testing of Remote Write in a realistic production like environment. With the upcomming Remote Write 2.0 changes to both the underlying implementation as well as the wire format, the need for benchmarking of remote write beyond static Go bechmark tests has increased.
- Expected Outcome: Build additional (or extends existing) tooling, similar to Prombench’s [load-generator](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/tools/load-generator) and [avalanche](https://github.com/prometheus-community/avalanche), to support scenarios under which remote write should be performance tested. For example; allowing gradual increases/decreases in # of active series, sudden spikes in active series, various amounts of latency in the server receiving the remote write data, etc. Time permitted, extend Prombench's test suite to include a set of Remote Write tests that can be run via a new command.
- Recommended Skills: Go, some familiarity with Prometheus or metrics, basic Docker knowledge

### Thanos

#### Compactor: Display TODO plan in UI

- Description: In the Thanos Compactor UI there is visibility of the global block list and loaded block list. But it would be useful to also have a list of planned and currently running compaction groups in order to see what exactly is in progress. This way it would be easier to diagnose what the Thanos Compactor is currently working on, and possibly what is delaying the progress of compactions. This is especially useful if you have large TSDB blocks in S3 buckets that take time to get compacted.
- Expected Outcome: We have an endpoint in Compactor that details compaction plan, and this is also visualized in a Compactor UI page.
- Recommended Skills: Go, React, some familiarity with Prometheus and Thanos

### Vitess

#### Improve the website of our automated-benchmarking tool (migrate to shadcn ui and typescript)

- Description:
    - Vitess uses arewefastyet to automatically benchmark its codebase and ensure no performance regression is introduced. This tool benchmarks Vitess every day, and is used to visualize the results of those benchmarks. It is an important tool in the development cycle of Vitess and is used by its maintainers and adopters.
    - [Arewefastyet' website](https://benchmark.vitess.io) has changed quite a lot over the last year, we want to continue improving it by finishing the migration to TypeScript and by using Shadcn components.
    - Moreover, we want to make the website responsive and have a proper Figma that serves as a reference for current and future contributors.
- Expected Outcome:
    - The mentee is expected to produce a Figma with the design of the website that will be co-authored with the mentor.
    - Re-vamp most of the pages using Shadcn and the design defined with the mentor at the start of the internship period.
    - Add type information for all/most components using TypeScript.
- Recommended Skills:
    - Be skilled in React/Vite/TypeScript.
    - Must know how to simply use Docker and docker-compose.
    - Experience with Figma is a big plus.
    - Experience with Rest APIs and Golang is a plus too.

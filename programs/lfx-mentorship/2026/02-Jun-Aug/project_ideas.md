## Proposed Project ideas

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger for GenAI Observability: Specialized Trace Visualization

- Description: Distributed tracing is essential for GenAI observability, but observing AI Agents differs fundamentally from observing microservices. While microservice traces focus on network latency and error codes, AI traces focus on the "reasoning process." The current Jaeger UI displays traces in a standard waterfall timeline, making it difficult to distinguish between logical "Tool Calls" and technical operations, and nearly impossible to read multi-paragraph prompts or view generated images. This project aims to transform the Jaeger UI into a first-class GenAI observability tool. When Jaeger detects a trace containing GenAI-specific metadata (following OpenTelemetry semantic conventions), it should automatically adapt its presentation to prioritize the "Agentic Flow."
- Expected Outcome:
  - Automatic "GenAI Mode" detection: detect `gen_ai.*` attributes and offer/switch to a specialized visualization mode
  - Agentic hierarchy with iconography: use distinct icons to differentiate span types (e.g., "brain" for LLM calls, "wrench" for tool calls, "database" for RAG retrieval)
  - Rich-media side panel leveraging ADR-0006 side-panel capability, with Markdown support for prompts and completions, pretty-printed JSON for tool inputs/outputs, and direct rendering of images/audio previews
  - Simplified "logical" view: toggle to hide infrastructure-level noise and reveal a clean, high-level reasoning flow
  - More compact table view of multiple traces on the Search page
- Recommended Skills: React, TypeScript, Ant Design components, OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (specifically for GenAI), basic knowledge of LLM application patterns (prompting, RAG, tool use)

### Kubescape

#### In-cluster, GitOps-native SecurityException CRD for Kubescape, with Headlamp plugin support

- Description: Kubescape today has no declarative, in-cluster mechanism for posture/compliance exceptions — they only come from JSON files or the ARMO cloud API, which blocks GitOps-native workflows and air-gapped clusters. A design for a `SecurityException` / `ClusterSecurityException` CRD (group `kubescape.io/v1`) already exists and covers both vulnerability and posture exceptions in a single resource with OpenVEX-compatible fields, label/namespace/image selectors, CEL validation, and Kubernetes Events for observability. The kubevuln (vulnerability) side is being implemented by the maintainers; this project focuses on the kubescape (posture) side, the operator rescan integration, and surfacing exceptions in the Kubescape Headlamp plugin so users can view and manage them from the UI.
- Expected Outcome:
  - New `CRDExceptionsGetter` implementing `IExceptionsGetter` in kubescape, wrapping the existing getter and merging CRD posture entries (`SecurityException → armotypes.PostureExceptionPolicy`).
  - Match-field conversion: `resources`, `objectSelector`, and `namespaceSelector` mapped to `PortalDesignator` attributes; cloud-vs-CRD precedence per the design (cloud wins on overlap).
  - `expiresAt` evaluated at scan time; scan-time Kubernetes Events emitted on matched SecurityException resources.
  - Operator `SecurityExceptionWatchHandler` watching both kinds with a debounced `CooldownQueue`, dispatching rescans on changes.
  - CRD manifests with CEL validation rules merged into the Helm chart.
  - Headlamp plugin additions: list/view `SecurityException` and `ClusterSecurityException` resources, show matched findings/events, and a guided form to create new exceptions from a failing control or CVE on a workload.
  - Unit + integration tests for the Go side, plugin tests for the UI, and end-to-end verification against a running cluster.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes (controllers, CRDs, client-go / controller-runtime, dynamic client), TypeScript/React (for the Headlamp plugin).

### Lima

#### Improve Windows support (host and guest)

- Description: Lima launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (similar to WSL2). Currently, Lima supports Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD as guest operating systems. The primary goal of this project is to expand this capability by adding support for Windows guests. Furthermore, the project aims to improve the stability and user experience of running Lima on Windows hosts. This will be achieved by removing dependencies like `cygpath.exe`, researching and developing a native Hyper-V(or a [HCS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/api/hcs/overview)) driver to provide optimized, native virtualization on Windows hosts.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Primary:
    - The ability to successfully launch and run Windows guest virtual machines using `limactl start template:windows` using the QEMU driver on any host.
    - Deliver a seamless installation experience on Windows hosts by automating configurations and eliminating the need for [manual setup notes](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/356038/changes#diff-9c16ba1b4e8cfc88d634b6cc436e0041d2201ac93e1d4fcd78fca09e0667ca3aR29)
    - Complete removal of the `cygpath.exe` dependency.
  - Secondary (if time permits):
    - Investigate and decide between Hyper-V and HCS for the native driver: HCS is the basis of WSL2 and may be available in Windows 11 Home Edition, while Hyper-V is only available in Pro/Enterprise editions. Research availability and integration feasibility.
    - Potentially integrate the chosen driver (Hyper-V or HCS) as an [external VM driver](https://lima-vm.io/docs/dev/drivers/).
  - Tertiary Goals (if time permits): Upgrade the existing WSL2 driver to drop image restrictions and allow users to run multiple instances, as well as exploring a simple graphical interface (`limagui.exe`) to launch virtual machines.
  
- Recommended Skills: Go, QEMU, Hyper-V, Windows Developer Environment, Systems programming

### OpenEverest

#### Transform everestctl into a Powerful Database Management CLI

- Description: OpenEverest is an open-source cloud-native database platform that helps developers deploy and manage PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and other databases on Kubernetes. Currently, `everestctl` serves primarily as an installation tool for deploying and deleting OpenEverest itself. However, users increasingly need a powerful command-line interface to manage their databases, clusters, and integrations directly from the terminal. This project aims to transform `everestctl` from a basic deployment tool into a comprehensive CLI for managing OpenEverest resources. The mentee will design and implement a modern, user-friendly CLI experience that allows users to provision databases, manage Kubernetes clusters, interact with OpenEverest plugins, and automate database operations — all without leaving their terminal. The project will involve working with Go, Kubernetes APIs, OpenEverest's plugin architecture, and modern CLI frameworks like Cobra.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Core database management commands: `everestctl db list`, `create`, `delete`, `get`, `logs` for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
  - Cluster management: `everestctl cluster list`, `register`, `status` for managing Kubernetes clusters
  - Plugin integration: `everestctl plugin list`, `install`, `configure` for OpenEverest plugins
  - Shell completion scripts (bash, zsh, fish)
  - Unit and integration tests with >80% coverage
  - Comprehensive documentation with usage examples

- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes (CRDs, operators, client-go), Cobra CLI framework, REST/gRPC APIs, database fundamentals (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB), Git/GitHub workflow

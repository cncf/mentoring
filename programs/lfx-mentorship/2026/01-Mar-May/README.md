## Accepted Projects

### Antrea

#### Compare Antrea BPF generation for PacketCapture to tcpdump / libpcap

CNCF - Antrea: Compare PacketCapture BPF generation vs tcpdump/libpcap (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Antrea's [PacketCapture feature](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/docs/packetcapture-guide.md) includes custom BPF code generation for packet filters defined in the PacketCapture CRD. The code is currently tested using manually-generated test cases, which is tedious, error-prone, and limits testing coverage. Given that the code attempts to mimic the BPF generation done by tcpdump, we should improve the testing approach by: 1) using AI to generate comprehensive test inputs, 2) using tcpdump to generate reference BPF code for the inputs, 3) comparing our generated BPF with the tcpdump reference, 4) analyzing any differences to determine if our BPF is incorrect or equivalent, 5) updating our BPF generation to match tcpdump when possible, and 6) committing all test cases to run in CI.
- Expected Outcome: A comprehensive test suite for the PacketCapture BPF generation code that uses tcpdump-generated BPF as a reference. The test suite should be integrated into CI and should increase testing coverage compared to the current manually-generated test cases. Any discrepancies between Antrea's BPF generation and tcpdump's should be analyzed and resolved, with the BPF generation code updated as needed to match tcpdump's output when appropriate.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter), basic understanding of packet filtering and tcpdump/libpcap. We encourage using AI tools to generate test cases and improve the BPF code generation, but we expect careful review of generated artifacts before submitting them for review.

### Drasi

#### Drasi for IoT: MQTT Integration and Real-Time Sensor Monitoring

CNCF - Drasi: IoT: MQTT integration and real-time sensor monitoring (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Drasi is a Data Change Processing platform that enables developers to detect and react to meaningful data changes using declarative Cypher queries. Drasi excels at complex change detection with unique features like `drasi.trueFor()` (detecting conditions that persist over time) and absence-of-change detection (alerting when expected events don't occur). However, it currently lacks native connectivity to IoT protocols.

  Drasi Lib provides Drasi's powerful graph-aware decision engine as an embeddable Rust library that can run completely offline on constrained hardware—enabling edge computing scenarios where logic runs directly on sensors and gateways. IoT applications fundamentally need to detect state transitions, but developers typically must write boilerplate code and manage state persistence manually. Drasi's diff-engine handles state management and change computation automatically, emitting events only when meaningful changes occur.

  MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is the de-facto standard protocol for IoT, used by AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub, and virtually every IoT deployment. Adding MQTT support to Drasi Lib will unlock the entire IoT ecosystem for Drasi users.

  In this project, the mentee will build a suite of lightweight Rust crates that enable Drasi Lib to communicate with MQTT brokers. They will create connectors to ingest sensor data (MQTT Source), execute local actions (Shell Reaction), and close the control loop (MQTT Reaction). Finally, they will demonstrate the complete stack with a demo showcasing Drasi's unique temporal capabilities for IoT.

  The mentee will gain hands-on experience with async Rust (tokio), IoT protocols (MQTT), stream processing concepts, and graph-based data modeling.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Build MQTT Source Plugin - A new Rust crate that enables Drasi to ingest data from MQTT brokers
  - Build Shell/Command Reaction - A new Rust crate that enables Drasi to execute local system commands based on query results
  - Build MQTT Reaction Plugin - A new Rust crate that enables Drasi to publish alerts/commands to MQTT topics
  - Create IoT Demo Scenario - A complete, runnable demonstration showing Drasi's power for IoT use cases
  - Create Documentation & Tutorial - Comprehensive guide for IoT developers to adopt Drasi
  - (Stretch Goal) Build InfluxDB Source - Enables Drasi to ingest from InfluxDB, unlocking Telegraf's 200+ input plugins for IoT
- Recommended Skills:
  - Rust (intermediate level: ownership, traits, async/await with tokio)
  - Basic understanding of IoT concepts (MQTT protocol, pub/sub patterns)
  - Git and GitHub workflow
  - (Helpful) Docker and Docker Compose for testing
  - (Helpful) Basic understanding of graph concepts or Cypher query language
  - (Helpful) Experience with message brokers (MQTT, Kafka, etc.)

Currently, the community offers several quick start methods, including a one-click setup script (hack/local-up-karmada.sh), installation tools such as Helm, karmadactl, and the operator, alongside learning tutorials on Killercoda.
Although the community's CI effectively maintains these installation methods, it lacks support for different operating systems, notably macOS. Furthermore, some Killercoda tutorials are outdated and do not reflect the latest features and best practices. This project aims to ease the entry barrier for new users by enhancing the quick start process, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and updating educational content.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Verify the feasibility of installing hack/local-up-karmada.sh on macOS environments, including both macOS ARM and Intel and address any issues that arise.
  - Implement a new CI workflow in GitHub Actions to test Karmada's installation and basic functionalities on macOS. GitHub Actions can select specific environments through runs-on, covering both macOS ARM and Intel.
  - Revise existing outdated scenarios on Killercoda and develop valuable new scenarios to guide users through current features. This includes:
    - Extracting common functions from various scenarios to reduce code duplication.
    - Updating the course information of existing scenarios by correcting outdated content and optimizing the material to enhance learning outcomes.
    - Adding new scenarios, such as:
      - A tutorial on FHPA usage.
      - An application-level failover guide.
      - Multi-component workload scheduling (support for workloads common in AI and big data).
- Recommended Skills:
  - Go programming language
  - Familiarity with macOS
  - Bash/shell scripting
  - CI/CD systems (e.g., GitHub Actions)
  - Documentation tools and best practices

#### OmniControl for Karmada Dashboard

CNCF - Karmada: OmniControl for Karmada Dashboard (2026 Term 1)

- Description: We have already implemented management for all types of resources on the control plane and for particial resources on member clusters in the Karmada Dashboard. However, resource management is currently atomic, and the relationships between resources are not presented intuitively. As a result, users may find it difficult to understand and manage relationship across resources.
For example:
1. On the control plane, after a user creates a ResourceTemplate, it is not easy to tell which Policy matched that ResourceTemplate and then generated the corresponding ResourceBinding and subsequent Work resources.
2. Across the control plane and member clusters plane, users cannot easily see which member clusters a ResourceTemplate has been propagated to, or the status of the distributed resources in each member cluster.
Therefore, we aim to provide a unified management and control capability (OmniControl). From the perspective of ResourceTemplate, users should be able to view the resource’s status on both the control plane and member clusters plane, building on the existing atomic capabilities. This will help users understand the end-to-end status of resources more intuitively and quickly identify and resolve issues when propagation or distribution failures occur.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Comprehensive design and API documentation
  - Topology visualization of Karmada core resources and Kubernetes resources ([Karmada architecture diagram](https://karmada.io/docs/core-concepts/architecture/))
  - Control-plane resource integration: users can view details of policy resources and multi-cloud resources by clicking the corresponding nodes in the topology graph (read-only)
  - Member-cluster resource integration: users can view details of Kubernetes resources (including workloads, configs, and services) with the same UX
  - A demo showcasing abnormal resource distribution cases (e.g., insufficient GPU resources; one example is sufficient)
- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Kubernetes
  - React
  - CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions)

#### Protect Karmada Component Flags from Unexpected Changes

CNCF - Karmada: Protect component flags from unexpected changes (2026 Term 1)

- Description: The Karmada project consists of several components (e.g., controller-manager, scheduler, karmada-search, etc.), each accepting various command-line flags for configuration. These flags come from multiple sources: third-party dependencies (e.g., Kubernetes, controller-runtime) and custom flags defined by Karmada itself. During dependency upgrades or internal refactoring, flags can be unexpectedly added, removed, or modified, potentially impacting users who rely on specific configurations. This project aims to create comprehensive documentation and tooling to track and document all flags for Karmada's maintained components, establishing a baseline to detect and manage flag changes carefully.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - Comprehensive flag documentation for all Karmada components (controller-manager, scheduler, karmada-search, webhook, aggregated-apiserver, descheduler, metrics-adapter, scheduler-estimator)
  - Automated flag extraction and documentation generation tool
  - CI/CD pipeline integration to detect and alert on flag changes

#### Modernize and improve kgateway end-to-end testing

CNCF - kgateway: Modernize and improve end-to-end testing (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Kgateway has a large number of end-to-end (e2e) tests that functionally test the full end-to-end flow of various routing and policy features present for both supported dataplane proxies, Envoy and agentgateway.

  However, these tests have been implemented with a custom e2e framework which is starting to show some cracks, notably around the speed of execution and general obtuseness of the framework.

  This project will contain two main phases:
  1. Analyze the gaps of the current custom e2e framework and work with kgateway maintainers to decide whether or not it is worth migrating to an alternative solution
  2. Depending on the outcome of phase 1, identify a set of e2e tests to either migrate to the new framework or improve the execution of in the current framework

  This project will provide exposure to a wide range of features in kgateway as well as real-world experience with ensuring the kgateway project is providing rock solid reliability for its users!

- Expected Outcome:
  - An approved design doc with a decision on whether to use the existing custom E2E framework vs. using an alternative approach

### krkn - Chaos

#### Enhancing Krkn-AI Result Analysis with Interactive Visualization and Insights

CNCF - krkn - Chaos: Krkn-AI Result Analysis with Visualization and Insights (2026 Term 1)

- Description: [Krkn-AI](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn-ai) generates rich but complex experiment outputs (JSON, CSV, YAML, graphs, and tables) capturing fitness scores, SLOs, health checks, and other metrics, which can be difficult for engineers to interpret and compare across experiments. Although recent work using LLMs to produce high-level textual summaries is helpful, text alone limits deeper exploration. This feature change proposes building an interactive analysis and visualization layer for Krkn-AI that transforms raw chaos experiment data into intuitive, explorable visual representations, enabling users to quickly understand system behavior, detect anomalies, and focus on the most impactful failure signals.
- Expected Outcome: The outcome is to deliver a simple web-based GUI or generated report built from Krkn-AI result artifacts (JSON, CSV, YAML), featuring interactive visualizations for key metrics such as fitness scores, SLOs, and health checks, along with clear highlighting of important or abnormal results to guide users’ attention.

### KubeEdge

#### Batch Enable/Disable of EdgeHub on Edge Nodes via kubeedge/keadm

CNCF - KubeEdge: Keadm: Batch enable/disable EdgeHub on edge nodes (2026 Term 1)

- Description: In bandwidth limited environments, as the cluster size expands, communication between cloud and edge nodes in KubeEdge consumes a significant amount of network resources, which may interfere with upper layer business applications. To alleviate this issue, it is necessary to implement batch enable or disable the EdgeHub edge node feature in keadm. Administrators can temporarily take edge nodes offline by turning off the EdgeHub switch, thereby releasing the bandwidth required for critical services. This feature should support adding subcommands in keadm for implementation.
- Expected Outcome: A keadm extension that provides commands or APIs to batch enable/disable the EdgeHub switch on specified edge nodes.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, KubeEdge

#### Cloud-Edge Simulation Benchmark for LLM Speculative Decoding in KubeEdge-Ianvs

CNCF - KubeEdge: Ianvs: Cloud-edge benchmark for LLM speculative decoding (2026 Term 1)

- Description: 
  LLM inference acceleration is increasingly important for cloud-edge collaborative AI deployments. Speculative decoding can improve end-to-end generation speed by using a lightweight draft model to propose token candidates and a larger target model to verify them, but its real-world gains depend heavily on cloud-edge constraints such as network latency, bandwidth limits, and heterogeneous compute. 
  Ianvs provides a unified benchmarking framework, and KubeEdge scenarios often require evaluating AI workloads under cloud-edge conditions. This project proposes a single-host cloud-edge simulation benchmark in Ianvs to evaluate speculative decoding for LLM inference. The benchmark will simulate edge (draft) and cloud (verify) roles as separate processes, inject configurable network constraints, and report standardized throughput and latency metrics, enabling reproducible comparison between baseline decoding and speculative decoding under different cloud-edge budgets.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - An Ianvs benchmark test case for cloud-edge speculative decoding (PyTorch + HuggingFace).
  - A single-host simulation runner that emulates edge/cloud roles and configurable network constraints (e.g., latency, bandwidth).
  - Benchmark reports comparing baseline vs speculative decoding with key metrics (e.g., TTFT, end-to-end latency, tokens/s), and reproducible configs/scripts.
- Recommended Skills: Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, LLM inference/decoding, benchmarking & performance profiling, KubeEdge/Ianvs basics

#### Comprehensive Example Restoration for KubeEdge Ianvs

CNCF - KubeEdge: Ianvs: Comprehensive example restoration (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Ianvs serves as the KubeEdge SIG AI distributed benchmark toolkit. As more and more contributors running, KubeEdge Ianvs now has 25 examples, and the number is still increasing. KubeEdge Ianvs then faces mounting usability issues due to dependency evolution and validation mechanisms. As Python versions, third-party libraries, and Ianvs features advance, partial historical examples fail to execute. This has led to surging user-reported Issues from confused contributors, untested PRs breaking core functionality of legacy features, and severely outdated documentation misaligning with actual capabilities. Without systematic intervention, the example risks becoming obsolete for edge-AI developers and especially newcomers. We then try to resurrect Ianvs’ usability with a comprehensive example restoration.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - Diagnose & fix bugs across examples, including dependency manifests, license scan, and runtime configurations.
  - Documentation Modernization, including revamp tutorials with reproducible step-by-step guides, publish developer-focused debugging playbooks for common failures. Write and upload the corresponding blog to the KubeEdge Website.
  - Advanced: Build a CI pipeline testing examples with GitHub Actions against multiple Python versions, critical Ianvs/upstream updates, and block PRs that break validated examples
  - Optional:  Preparing KubeEdge SIG AI speaking and marketing materials for open-source community events like KCD Days 2026 (in Beijing, thus writing and speaking skills in Mandarin would be a plus).

#### Cluster API Provider AWS (CAPA)

##### Improve AMI Publication and Maintenance

CNCF - Kubernetes: CAPA: Improve AMI publication and maintenance (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Cluster API Provider AWS (CAPA) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in AWS with Cluster API. CAPA allows you create EKS and non-EKS based Kubernetes clusters. When creating a non-EKS cluster we must use AMIs for the nodes in the cluster. The project publishes some AMIs for non-production use. However, the process for publishing the AMIs needs improvment. Firstly we want to fully automate the publication of new AMIs when there is a new Kubernetes version available. Secondly, we need to implement the "AMI Publication Policy" for the project which will involve automated house keeping of AMIs. And thirdly we want to add back support for base operating systems that where temporarily dropped.
- Expected Outcome: Automated AMI publication and deletion inline with the projects policy. Support for additional operating systems.
- Recommended Skills: AWS, GitHub Actions, Packer, Ansible, Kubernetes

#### Kubespray

##### Automate building OS images for supported/CI tested distribution

CNCF - Kubernetes: Kubespray: Automate OS image pipeline for CI (2026 Term 1)

- Description: This feature request aims to automate the building and publishing of OS images that are used in Kubespray CI testing. Currently, these images (defined in `test-infra/image-builder/roles/kubevirt-images/defaults/main.yml`) must be manually created and pushed by maintainers. Automating this process would reduce manual work, eliminate bottlenecks when maintainers are unavailable, and could include automatic cleanup of outdated or unused images, while still retaining images needed for older supported release branches. 
- Expected Outcome: A CI job (likely post-merge and possibly periodic) that automatically:
	1.	Builds the required Kubespray OS images used in CI for tested distributions.
	2.	Pushes these built images to the appropriate registry.
	3.	Cleans up old or no longer needed images but retains those required for supported release branches.
This workflow should remove the need for maintainers to manually create and manage these images.
- Recommended Skills: Ansible, GitLab CI, Python

### Meshery

#### Adapter for AI and LLMs

CNCF - Meshery: Adapter for AI and LLMs (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Meshery is the open-source cloud native manager that empowers platform engineers to design and operate infrastructure. As infrastructure complexity grows, the need for intelligent assistance becomes critical. This project focuses on developing and enhancing a dedicated AI Adapter and AI Connections for Meshery. This adapter serves as the bridge between Meshery’s core orchestration engine and various Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to enable "Natural Language to Infrastructure" capabilities, allowing users to describe their architectural intent (e.g., "Deploy a highly available Kubernetes cluster on AWS with Prometheus monitoring") and have Meshery auto-generate the visual topology and configuration manifests. The intern will work on decoupling the AI logic from the core platform, allowing users to "Bring Your Own Model" (BYOM)—supporting both cloud-based providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) and local inference runners (Ollama, LocalAI).
- Recommended Skills:
  - Proficiency in Golang (Go) is essential, as Meshery’s backend is written in Go.
  - Familiarity with MCP Servers, REST APIs, LLM APIs (OpenAI, Vertex AI), local inference servers (Ollama).
  - Basic understanding of Kubernetes, Docker, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) concepts.
  - Experience with REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.
  - Nice to have: Experience with React (for frontend integration in Meshery UI).
- Responsibilities:
  - Co-design and implement the interface for the AI Adapter in Go to communicate with the Meshery Server.
  - Implement support for connecting to local LLMs (via Ollama) to ensure data privacy for users who cannot send infrastructure data to the public cloud.
  - Improve the "System Prompt" and context-window management to feed the LLM relevant data regarding Meshery Models (schema definitions) so the AI generates valid infrastructure configurations.
  - Write unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the adapter.
  - Create user guides on how to configure the adapter with different AI providers.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A fully functional AI Adapter (or Connection) integrated into the Meshery ecosystem.
  - Demonstrable capability for users to swap between at least two different LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI vs. a local Llama 3 model).
  - Implementation of a feature where natural language queries result in a rendered design.
  - Merged pull requests (PRs) including code, tests, and documentation.

#### Graph Database Integration

CNCF - Meshery: Graph Database Integration (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Meshery's *MeshSync* component acts as the real-time discovery engine, maintaining an up-to-date snapshot of all managed infrastructure. Currently, mapping the complex relationships between these resources (e.g., a Service selecting Pods which are mounted to PVCs) relies on relational or in-memory lookups that can become inefficient at scale. This project involves integrating a dedicated graph database (or an embedded graph processing library) into Meshery's architecture. The goal is to ingest discovered Kubernetes resources as "nodes" and their associations (OwnerReferences, Label Selectors, Annotations) as "edges." This shift will enable highly efficient traversal and querying of infrastructure data, powering more advanced capabilities like topology visualization, impact analysis, and dependency mapping.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Strong proficiency in Golang as both MeshSync and Meshery's Kubernetes operator are written in Go.
  - Understanding of openCypher, graph theory and Graph Databases (e.g., NebulaGraph, or embedded Go graph libraries like `gonum` or `cayley`).
  - Strong familiarity with Kubernetes Controllers, Informers, and the Object Model (GVK/GVR).
  - Experience and competency with GraphQL
- Responsibilities:
  - Refactor the MeshSync ingestion layer to map incoming Kubernetes objects to graph nodes and generate edges based on semantic relationships (e.g., `Service` -> `Pod`).
  - Integrate Meshery Relationships as first-class citizens in the graph schema to represent higher-level associations.
  - Implement the storage interface in the Meshery Operator to persist these graph structures efficiently.
  - Develop new GraphQL resolvers in the Meshery Server that utilize graph traversal queries to fetch topology data.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Fully-functional datastores of discovered cluster data into a graph structure.
  - Benchmarks demonstrating improved performance for complex relationship queries compared to the existing relational implementation.
  - Successful rendering of the infrastructure topology in Meshery UI using data fetched from the new graph backend.
  - Comprehensive documentation covering the new graph schema and query patterns.

#### Relationships for AWS services

CNCF - Meshery: Relationships for AWS services (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Meshery Models are declarative representations of infrastructure and applications. Within these models, Relationships define how different Components (e.g., Kubernetes resources, Cloud services) interact and depend on each other. These relationships are crucial for visualizing, understanding, and managing complex cloud native systems. This internship focuses on significantly expanding the breadth and depth of Meshery Relationships across a wide array of technologies supported by Meshery. As Meshery continues to integrate with more cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, public clouds, and all CNCF projects), there's a growing need to accurately model the intricate relationships between their components - vital for providing users with comprehensive insights and control over their deployments.
- Recommended Skills: DevOps, systems administration, solutions architecture. Experience with Kubernetes, AWS and its services.
- Responsibilities:
  - Research and Analyze Technologies: Dive deep into various cloud-native technologies (e.g., different compute services, databases, messaging systems, network services, etc.) to understand their components and how they interconnect.
  - Develop Relationship Definitions: Create and contribute relationship definitions, typically in JSON or YAML format, to the Meshery models. 
  - Model Inter-Technology Interactions: Focus particularly on defining relationships between components from different technologies (e.g., how a Kubernetes deployment relates to an AWS RDS instance, or how a Linkerd service interacts with a Prometheus monitoring component).
  - Document New Relationships: Clearly document the newly defined relationships, their purpose, and how they are represented within Meshery designs, contributing to the official Meshery documentation.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A multitude of new relationships defined both intra and inter AWS services.
  - Policy Contribution: For advanced interns, there may be opportunities to contribute to the Rego policies that evaluate and enforce these relationships.

### OpenCost

#### OpenCost UI Revamp

CNCF - OpenCost: OpenCost UI Revamp (2026 Term 1)

- Description: OpenCost has helped a lot of people save a lot of money on their infrastructure. We like to think that this has contributed to things like engineering headcounts not getting reduced, small businesses and startups surviving longer, and so on. The OpenCost UI is a key part of this - it lets people visualize their spend, find inefficiencies, and so on. It's time to uplevel the OpenCost UI to enable the next generation of savings!
- Expected Outcome: We would like all pages of the OpenCost app to be implemented in Carbon or similar modern design system. We would like dashboarding functionality and a unified color scheme. All implementations should be delivered with unit and end-to-end tests. All existing functionality of the UI should be present in the revamped design.

### OpenKruise

#### KruiseGame Cloud-Hosted Version Development

CNCF - OpenKruise: KruiseGame cloud-hosted version development (2026 Term 1)

- Description: OKG has attracted many large game companies to embrace cloud-native transformation. However, for many small and medium-sized game companies, they are not familiar with the container and Kubernetes ecosystem. Due to their smaller team sizes, they have relatively weak infrastructure management capabilities. To democratize cloud-native technology for more game companies, OKG plans to launch a cloud-hosted version. Users can deploy the runtime environment with one click and complete game service integration based on the official SDK. This will reduce the complexity of using infrastructure for game companies and adapt to multi-cloud environments.

### OpenTelemetry

#### Tooling for detecting impact of behavioral changes in Go libraries

CNCF - OpenTelemetry: Tooling for detecting impact of behavioral changes in Go lib (2026 Term 1)

- Description:
  Maintenance of a stable Go library often involves value-judgement calls regarding what changes can impact downstream consumers. While some existing tooling like [apidiff](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/apidiff) can go some way towards preventing breakage, these tools work purely in terms of API-level breakage such as changing the type of a symbol. Inspired by [tooling in other language ecosystems such as Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater) this proposal sets out to build a tool that can give statistical information about the impact of any change on downstream consumers by running the build pipelines and test suites of dependents before and after a particular change. This would empower maintainers to make better informed choices about changes and foster an ecosystem. We think this is specially important for the OpenTelemetry project since the OpenTelemetry Go modules and the OpenTelemetry Collector modules are foundational modules used within the CNCF on other projects (e.g Kubernetes, Jaeger) as well as outside of it. The intent is to build a tool that could be used as well by other CNCF projects since Go is the *lingua franca* of the foundation, enabling all projects to have a flourishing ecosystem.
- Expected Outcome:
  We would like to have a tool written in Go that is able to (i) gather all publicly-listed dependencies of a module, (ii) safely run the test suite of dependencies for a given version of the code and (iii) compare two test suites and provide a statistical summary of the differences between the two to help in decision-making.
- Recommended Skills: 
   - Working Golang skills including testing and building Go code
   - Working knowledge of CI/CD systems
   - Containerization and securely running untrusted code

### OpenYurt

#### Implement Label-Driven Automated Installation and Uninstallation of YurtHub on Edge Nodes

CNCF - OpenYurt: Label-driven install/uninstall of YurtHub on edge nodes (2026 Term 1)

- Description:
  Currently, in OpenYurt, the core component YurtHub—which acts as a transparent proxy between edge node system components (e.g., kubelet, CNI, CoreDNS, kube-proxy) and the Kubernetes API server—is deployed as a systemd service on each edge node. The installation is performed exclusively via the community-provided tool YurtAdm during node joining.
  This approach imposes a significant limitation: users must use YurtAdm to onboard nodes, making it impossible to install YurtHub on existing Kubernetes nodes that were not initially provisioned with YurtAdm. To improve flexibility and user experience, the community aims to support a label-driven, declarative installation mechanism:
  - When a specific label (e.g., openyurt.io/is-edge-worker=true) is added to a node, YurtHub should be automatically installed and started on that node.
  - Conversely, when the label is removed, YurtHub should be gracefully uninstalled and its resources cleaned up.
  This enhancement will enable seamless integration of OpenYurt into existing Kubernetes clusters without requiring re-onboarding of nodes.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement a controller/operator that watches for node labels and triggers YurtHub lifecycle operations.
  - Develop an installation/uninstallation mechanism that:
    - Installs YurtHub as a systemd service.
    - Ensures idempotency and handles failures gracefully.
    - Cleans up all YurtHub-related files, configurations, and services upon label removal.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing YurtAdm-based deployments.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation, including:
    - User guide for enabling label-driven YurtHub management.
    - Design rationale and architecture diagram.
  - Add e2e tests covering both installation and uninstallation scenarios in a real cluster environment.

- Recommended Skills:
  - Strong proficiency in Go programming language.
  - Solid understanding of Kubernetes architecture, especially node lifecycle, kubelet, and API machinery.
  - Experience with Kubernetes controllers/operators (client-go, controller-runtime).
  - Familiarity with systemd and Linux system service management (for interacting with systemd during install/uninstall).
  - Knowledge of OpenYurt architecture (especially YurtHub and YurtAdm) is a plus but not mandatory.
  - Experience writing unit and e2e tests for Kubernetes components.
  - Good communication and documentation skills.

### Prometheus

#### Improving Documentation for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Interoperability

CNCF - Prometheus: Improve docs for Prometheus & OpenTelemetry interoperability (2026 Term 1)

- Description:
  Prometheus and OpenTelemetry are commonly deployed together, yet many users struggle to understand how the two systems interoperate — especially around concepts such as resource attributes, label mapping, attribute promotion, and recommended integration patterns.

  [Prior UX research](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/ux-research-prometheus-otel/) identified documentation gaps as a primary source of confusion, and [ongoing community discussions](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2026/slack-community-insights/) continue to surface similar questions. While both projects provide extensive documentation, guidance is often fragmented, highly technical, or lacks practical end-to-end explanations for real-world usage.

  This mentorship focuses on improving the clarity, usability, and consistency of documentation that explains how Prometheus and OpenTelemetry work together. The mentee will analyze existing documentation across both projects, identify high-impact gaps or friction points, and collaborate with mentors to design and deliver meaningful documentation improvements upstream.

  The project is intentionally exploratory and iterative. Part of the mentorship is learning how to evaluate documentation quality, prioritize improvements, and define ways to measure the impact of documentation changes made during the program.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Review and audit existing Prometheus and OpenTelemetry documentation related to interoperability.
  - Define a prioritized documentation improvement plan together with the mentors.
  - Produce and submit documentation improvements upstream in one or both projects. These may include conceptual explanations, practical guides, examples, diagrams, and cross-project references.
  - Establish basic criteria or methods to evaluate documentation effectiveness during the mentorship.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Prior experience with technical writing or clear motivation to pursue a Tech Writing career.
  - Familiarity with Git and contributing via pull requests.

#### Start scraping immediately on startup without waiting for WAL replay to finish

CNCF - Prometheus: Start scraping immediately on startup without waiting for WAL replay to finish (2026 Term 1)

- Description:
  When a large Prometheus is running in HA mode (i.e. 2 identical Prometheus scraping same targets) and it needs to be restarted (for upgrades, etc), there can be a temporary gap in queries when the second Prometheus is restarting. This is because the first Prometheus did not scrape any metrics when it was restarting (this is the gap), and when second Prometheus is restarting, only the first Prometheus is serving queries.

  To mitigate this, we want to start scraping targets as soon as Prometheus starts up, without waiting for it to complete the WAL replay and restore the old in-memory state. However, querying is still only enabled after WAL replay is over, but there won't be gaps in scraped data anymore.

  This project includes careful designing of low level technical challenges, including ensuring the correct handling of WAL records and seamlessly stitching together the new scraped data and the data restored from WAL without a lot of memory overhead.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Design the correct handling of WAL records where the series information lines up between the old WAL and newly scraped data.
  - Design a low overhead method to stitch together the scraped data and the data restored from WAL.
  - Production ready PR with comprehensive test coverage. Ideally we will do the review iterations and merge the PR within this timeline.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Basic understanding of Go.
  - Comfortable diving deep into low level system code.
  - Familiarity with unit testing.

### urunc

#### Create a dashboard and a notification system for CI testing in `urunc`

CNCF - urunc: Dashboard and notification system for CI testing (2026 Term 1)

- Description:

GitHub Actions provides detailed views of CI workflows at the repository level,
but it can be difficult for maintainers to quickly track the overall status of
recurring workflows, such as nightly tests, over time. Important
information, like historical failures or trends, often requires manual
inspection of individual workflow runs.

This work aims to improve CI observability for `urunc` by creating a
centralized dashboard that presents an aggregated view of its nightly (and
other CI) test workflows. The dashboard will provide maintainers with a clear
overview of recent runs, success and failure states, and relevant metadata in a
single place.

In addition to visualization, this work includes the design and implementation of a
notification mechanism that alerts maintainers when tests fail. This
will help ensure that regressions are noticed quickly and addressed in a timely
manner, improving overall project reliability.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implementation of a dashboard summarizing nightly (and CI) test results.
  - Clear visualization of workflow status and execution history.
  - Implementation of a notification system for nightly test failures.
  - Documentation describing the dashboard, notification setup, and maintenance.

- Recommended Skills:
  - Basic understanding of CI/CD, GitHub Actions and GitHub API.
  - Experience with a suitable programming language (e.g., Go, Python, JavaScript)

#### Investigate missing custom OCI Annotations in urunc containers

CNCF - urunc: Investigate missing custom OCI annotations in urunc containers (2026 Term 1)

- Description:

In order to pass sandbox-specific configuration, such as the guest type,
monitor type, rootfs information and others, `urunc` relies on a set of [custom
OCI annotations](https://urunc.io/package/#annotations). However, these
annotations are missing from the container's configuration in
non-Kubernetes-deployments. To work around this issue, a `urunc.json` file
containing the same information is currently injected into the container’s
root filesystem. This works aims to investigate the OCI image build and runtime
flow to understand where and why these custom annotations are dropped or
ignored in non-Kubernetes setups.

- Expected Outcome:
  - A clear summary of the investigation, including where and why the custom
    annotations are lost.
  - A proposed solution enabling `urunc` to correctly consume its custom OCI
    annotations.
  - Alternatively, the design and implementation of a cleaner mechanism than
    injecting a file into the container’s root filesystem.

- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Familiarity with container tools (docker, nerdctl, skopeo etc.)
  - Familiarity with container runtimes (containerd, runc, urunc)
  - familiarity with the OCI specification

#### Optimizing Rootfs Handling with block-based snapshotters in `urunc`

CNCF - urunc: Optimize rootfs handling with block-based snapshotters (2026 Term 1)

- Description:

When `urunc` is used together with a block-based snapshotter, it can take
advantage of block-device backed container root filesystem and pass it
directly to the sandbox as a disk image. This approach avoids filesystem
conversion and enables efficient access to the container root filesystem.

However, in order to spawn the sandbox, urunc requires access to the guest
kernel and the initrd (if present). Since these files are part of the
container rootfs, `urunc` must first extract and store them elsewhere before
attaching the block-based root filesystem to the sandbox. As a result, this
process introduces unnecessary file copies and additional I/O overhead.

A more efficient approach is to leverage read-only (view) snapshots. Instead of
copying files, `urunc` could request a read-only snapshot of the container root
filesystem and mount it separately. The kernel binary and other required
artifacts could then be read directly from this snapshot without modifying or
duplicating data. Since view snapshots simply redirect read requests to the
underlying snapshot layers, this approach is expected to introduce little to no
additional storage overhead while simplifying the runtime flow.

- Expected Outcome:
  - A document explaining block-based snapshots in containerd, along with the
    respective APIs to snapshot creation and management.
  - An implementation in `urunc` that requests and mounts a read-only snapshot
    of the container root filesystem.
  - Evaluation of performance, storage overhead, and limitations of the
    snapshot-based approach.

- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Familiarity with containerd
  - Familiarity with Linux filesystems and block devices

### Volcano

#### Add Volcano to Headlamp: Job and Queue Management UI

CNCF - Volcano: Add Volcano to Headlamp: Job & Queue Management UI (2026 Term 1)

- Description:
  Volcano is a batch scheduling system for Kubernetes. This project will create a Headlamp plugin that adds first-class UI support for Volcano resources and workflows. The plugin will help users discover, inspect, and manage Volcano objects (e.g., queues, jobs, podgroups) directly inside Headlamp, making batch/HPC-style scheduling easier to operate from a Kubernetes UI. The idea is aligned with maintainer interest in a Volcano-focused Headlamp plugin. 

- Expected Outcome:
  - A working Headlamp plugin that can list and display key Volcano CRDs (e.g., Queue, Job, PodGroup) with meaningful status and relationships. Relevant Volcano related metrics displayed (on map and overview/detail pages).
  - Detail pages for Volcano resources with common actions (where appropriate) such as viewing events, related pods, and logs.
  - UX that fits Headlamp’s plugin patterns (navigation, list/detail views, and resource integration) and is packaged in a way consistent with the Headlamp plugin ecosystem. [1](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins), [2](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/development/plugins/)
  - Documentation covering installation, development workflow, and how to test against a cluster with Volcano installed.
  - Blog post on Kubernetes Blog about the project

- Recommended Skills:
  - TypeScript + React 
  - (Optional) Headlamp UI/plugin development, or other open source development
  - (Optional) Kubernetes fundamentals (CRDs, controllers, RBAC)
  - (Optional) Familiarity with Volcano concepts (queues, batch scheduling semantics)

#### E2E Test Suite for Volcano Agent Scheduling

CNCF - Volcano: E2E test suite for Volcano agent scheduling (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Volcano has introduced Agent Scheduling feature that supports fast scheduling for AI agent workloads. This includes ShardingController for shard management, agent scheduler for agent workloads scheduling, and enhanced existing Volcano batch scheduler with sharding support to coordinated scheduling with agent scheduler. To ensure correctness and stability of this new scheduling mechanism, we need to build a comprehensive end-to-end (e2e) test suite. Test cases should cover key scenarios including shard creation, node assignment across shards, agent scheduler scheduling in different sharding modes, etc.

- Expected Outcome:

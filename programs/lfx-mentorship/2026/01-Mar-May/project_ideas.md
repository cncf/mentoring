## Proposed Project ideas

### Knative

#### Enhancing the Knative Educational Game with Advanced EDA Patterns and Web Deployment

- Description: Knative provides a powerful event-driven platform, but learning its concepts, especially brokers and EDA patterns, can be challenging for beginners. The Knative Educational Game aims to simplify this learning curve through interactive gameplay that visually and conceptually demonstrates Knative components and event-driven patterns. 

An overview of the project was presented at the [KubeCon NA 2024](https://youtu.be/TTBKh6F4v-g?si=MRmx6a2YJsl7y0Q-), and several technical sketches, gameplay patterns, and level designs were created and implemented during the [LFX Mentorship of Spring 2025](https://github.com/knative-extensions/educational-game/blob/main/Levels/brainstorm.md).

This project serves as the continuation of that work and is divided into two main parts:
  - The first part focuses on expanding and enhancing the game by implementing existing level designs, introducing advanced EDA patterns (like Outbox and DataRef patterns), designing assets as needed, and improving interactivity.
  - The second part focuses on deploying the game to the web, making it easily accessible for learners to try and share.


- Expected Outcome:
  - A fully implemented and web-deployed Knative Educational Game by completing previously designed levels, and newly added EDA patterns (DataRef and Outbox).
  - Improved learning experience through interactive animations, sounds, and clear visualizations that make Knative Eventing concepts and real-world patterns easier to understand.
  - A Netlify hosted web deployment integrated into the Knative website.

- Recommended Skills: Godot, Game Development, Event Driven Architecture, Graphic Design.

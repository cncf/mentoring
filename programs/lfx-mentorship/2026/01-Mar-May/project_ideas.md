## Proposed Project ideas

### KubeStellar

#### Documentation and Self-Service Enablement Specialist

- Description: : KubeStellar is a Kubernetes-native multi-cluster synchronization platform. This project focuses on creating a frictionless onboarding experience, enabling first-time users to deploy KubeStellar end-to-end in under 30 minutes using only self-service documentation. The work includes deployment audits, Quickstart optimization, interactive tutorials, video guides, and structured troubleshooting, use-case, and migration documentation to improve adoption and reduce support overhead.  
- Expected Outcome: A validated ≤30-minute Quickstart guide, an interactive hands-on tutorial with automated checks, a 5–7 module video series, a 20-issue troubleshooting guide, 5 production-ready use-case patterns, 3 migration guides from common multi-cluster setups, and measurable onboarding success (≤30 min time-to-first-success, ≥4/5 user satisfaction).  
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes deployment and troubleshooting, strong technical writing, Markdown-based documentation tools (Docusaurus/Nextra), user-centric documentation design video, DevOps or DevRel background a plus

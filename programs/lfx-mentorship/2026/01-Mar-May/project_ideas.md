## Proposed Project ideas

### OpenCost

#### OpenCost UI Revamp

- Description: OpenCost has helped a lot of people save a lot of money on their infrastructure. We like to think that this has contributed to things like engineering headcounts not getting reduced, small businesses and startups surviving longer, and so on. The OpenCost UI is a key part of this - it lets people visualize their spend, find inefficiencies, and so on. It's time to uplevel the OpenCost UI to enable the next generation of savings!
- Expected Outcome: We would like all pages of the OpenCost app to be implemented in Carbon or similar modern design system. We would like dashboarding functionality and a unified color scheme. All implementations should be delivered with unit and end-to-end tests. All existing functionality of the UI should be present in the revamped design.
- Recommended Skills: React, UX Design, Frontend Development, APIs, Carbon Design System

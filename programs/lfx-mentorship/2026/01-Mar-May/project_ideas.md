## Proposed Project ideas

### OpenYurt

#### Implement Label-Driven Automated Installation and Uninstallation of YurtHub on Edge Nodes
- Description:
  Currently, in OpenYurt, the core component YurtHub—which acts as a transparent proxy between edge node system components (e.g., kubelet, CNI, CoreDNS, kube-proxy) and the Kubernetes API server—is deployed as a systemd service on each edge node. The installation is performed exclusively via the community-provided tool YurtAdm during node joining.
  This approach imposes a significant limitation: users must use YurtAdm to onboard nodes, making it impossible to install YurtHub on existing Kubernetes nodes that were not initially provisioned with YurtAdm. To improve flexibility and user experience, the community aims to support a label-driven, declarative installation mechanism:
  - When a specific label (e.g., openyurt.io/is-edge-worker=true) is added to a node, YurtHub should be automatically installed and started on that node.
  - Conversely, when the label is removed, YurtHub should be gracefully uninstalled and its resources cleaned up.
  This enhancement will enable seamless integration of OpenYurt into existing Kubernetes clusters without requiring re-onboarding of nodes.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement a controller/operator that watches for node labels and triggers YurtHub lifecycle operations.
  - Develop an installation/uninstallation mechanism that:
    - Installs YurtHub as a systemd service.
    - Ensures idempotency and handles failures gracefully.
    - Cleans up all YurtHub-related files, configurations, and services upon label removal.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing YurtAdm-based deployments.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation, including:
    - User guide for enabling label-driven YurtHub management.
    - Design rationale and architecture diagram.
  - Add e2e tests covering both installation and uninstallation scenarios in a real cluster environment.

- Recommended Skills:
  - Strong proficiency in Go programming language.
  - Solid understanding of Kubernetes architecture, especially node lifecycle, kubelet, and API machinery.
  - Experience with Kubernetes controllers/operators (client-go, controller-runtime).
  - Familiarity with systemd and Linux system service management (for interacting with systemd during install/uninstall).
  - Knowledge of OpenYurt architecture (especially YurtHub and YurtAdm) is a plus but not mandatory.
  - Experience writing unit and e2e tests for Kubernetes components.
  - Good communication and documentation skills.

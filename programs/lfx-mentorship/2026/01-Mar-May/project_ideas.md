## Proposed Project ideas

### Fluid

#### Design and implement a CLI tool to help easily use Fluid

CNCF - Fluid: Design and implement a CLI tool for Fluid (2026 Term 1)

- Description: Fluid manages Kubernetes resources (Statefulsets, PersistentVolumeClaims & PersistentVolume, etc.) under two Fluid custom resources CR called `Dataset` and `Runtime`. Given a pair of Dataset and Runtime CR, users may want to inspect the underlying resources, check their status and diagnose which part is going wrong. A CLI tool (e.g. a kubectl plugin) for Fluid would be a straightforward way for Fluid's users to easily get such information.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement a CLI tool for Fluid
  - Support `inspect` subcommand: list resource status given a Fluid Dataset CR.
  - Support `diagnose` subcommand: collect related information (e.g. logs, pod status, etc.) to help diagnose what's going wrong.
  - Implement a framework to diagnose Fluid with LLM/AI. (The collected information can be put into the context of an AI inference request)

- Recommended Skills: Fluid, Go, CLI tool development, LangChain(or other alternative LLM frameworks)

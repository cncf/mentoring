# CNCF Community Bridge mentors evaluation form

The Community Bridge mentors have to fill out the evaluation form after every major program milestone.
This form collects the feedback from the mentors on the program and the quality of the projects, as well as get the mentees paid (partial or in full).

This feedback is internal only (for the program admins) and is not shared publicly.

## Evaluation questions:
- Your Name *
- Which CNCF project are you representing as a mentor? *
- Mentee's Name *
- How would you rate your student's performance overall? (Rank 1-5, where 1 is the negative performance, 5 - positive) *
- Is your student on track to complete their project? *
- What is the quality of code/work your student has produced so far? (Rank 1-5, where 1 is the negative quality, 5 - positive quality) *
- For this evaluation, should your student pass or fail? *
- Feedback on your mentee (won't be shared with the mentee) *
- Feedback for the program overall (optional)

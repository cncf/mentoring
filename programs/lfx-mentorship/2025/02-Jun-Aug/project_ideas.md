## Proposed Project ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Graduate the kubeadm feature gate WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents to GA

- Description:  
The feature gate WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents is used to
enhance the health checks performed by kubeadm on control plane node creation,
to not only check the availability of the kube-apisever, but also check
the kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. In kubeadm 1.33, the feature gate
was promoted to Beta. As part of this LFX project it can be promoted to GA,
by finalizing the remaining work, such as, code changes, documentation updates
and e2e test updates.
- Expected Outcome: The feature gate is graduated to GA
- Recommended Skills: golang, Kubernetes, kubeadm

### KubeStellar

#### Building a Marketplace for KubeStellar Plugins

- Description:  
This project aims to develop a marketplace system for KubeStellar that will allow users to discover, install, and manage plugins that extend KubeStellar's functionality. The marketplace will provide a centralized hub for community-contributed plugins, enhancing KubeStellar's extensibility and user experience. The implementation will include a backend API written in Go and a frontend interface built with React.

- Expected Outcome
  - A fully functional plugin marketplace integrated into KubeStellar's UI
  - Backend API for plugin management (upload, discovery, installation, updates)
  - Frontend components for browsing, searching, and installing plugins
  - Plugin versioning and compatibility checking
  - User ratings and reviews for plugins
  - Documentation for plugin developers and users

- Recommended Skills
  - Go 
  - React.ts
  - REST API
  - Kubernetes
  - KubeStellar 
  - Docker
  - containerization
  - Git
  - GitHub workflow

#### Implementing a Model Context Protocol for KubeStellar MCP Server

- Description:  
This project aims to develop a Model Context Protocol for KubeStellar's Management Control Plane (MCP) server. The protocol will establish a standardized communication framework between KubeStellar's internal components and the AI models used for command interpretation. By defining clear context boundaries, semantic structures, and state management patterns, the protocol will enable the MCP server to maintain consistent understanding of the multi-cluster environment while processing natural language management commands across KubeStellar deployments.

- Expected Outcome
  - A fully specified Model Context Protocol defining the interaction between KubeStellar and AI models
  - Implementation of protocol handlers in TypeScript or Python for the MCP server
  - Context management system that maintains KubeStellar state information for accurate command interpretation
  - Serialization and deserialization mechanisms for efficiently passing cluster state to models
  - Protocol extension mechanisms for supporting different AI providers
  - Performance optimizations for minimizing latency in command processing
  - Comprehensive test suite validating protocol reliability under various operational conditions

- Recommended Skills
  - KubeStellar
  - Model Context Protocol
  - protocol design and implementation
  - TypeScript
  - Python
  - AI model
  - GenAi  
  - serialization formats 
  - efficient data structures
  - distributed systems state management

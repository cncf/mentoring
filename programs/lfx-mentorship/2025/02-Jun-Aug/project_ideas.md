  However, the ability to operate across multiple clusters is an important feature in Istio's traditional Sidecar mode, and work to support
  it in Istio's Ambient mode is making rapid progress. To call any feature complete,
  comprehensive testing is needed. Given that multicluster Istio Ambient is a new mode of operating, we will
  need to both adapt tests for existing features to ensure they work across multiple clusters,
  as well as identify multi-cluster specific scenarios we want to codify in tests.

  These kinds of tests exist mode in both the main Istio repository, as well as in the istio.io
  website's repository. The docs tests are equally as important, as they prove that the
  instructions we give to users actually work.

expectedOutcome:
  - Audit existing ambient integration tests for cases that do not support multi-cluster testing patterns.
  - Refactor those tests, using Istio's testing infrastructure to cover features within a multi-cluster environment.
  - Work with Istio maintainers to identify opportunities for testing new scenarios that exist only for ambient multi-cluster.
  - As documentation is written for https://istio.io, verify that the user instructions (kubectl commands, YAML snippets, etc.) actually work end-to-end.
  - Gain hands-on experience with Istio's codebase, service mesh architectures, and Kubernetes multi-cluster patterns.
  - Help us catch regressions and bugs

### Krkn

#### Chaos scenario rollback feature

- Description:<br/>
We intend to refactor the current Scenario Plugin API and add a new feature in the plugin abstract class to restore all the changes performed by krkn in the cluster in case run method encounters some kind of exception before ending the execution and or if the run failed for external infrastructure failures.
- Expected Outcome:<br/>
The cluster status should be rolled back to the original condition before the scenario execution.
- Recommended Skills:<br/>
  - python
  - kubernetes
  - container runtime environments
  - common cloud platforms

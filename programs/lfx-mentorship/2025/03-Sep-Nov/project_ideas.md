## Proposed Project ideas

### Cilium

#### Evaluate SEO, AEO, and AIO for cilium.io

- Description: Improve how cilium.io content is discovered, ranked, and reused by search engines and AI tools. This includes enhancing technical SEO, optimizing for answer engines like Google SGE and Perplexity (AEO), and structuring content to be easily cited and used by large language models (AIO). The mentee will perform audits, recommend improvements, and implement changes across meta tags, structured data, documentation formatting, and content strategy.
- Expected Outcome: SEO, AEO, and AIO audit report for cilium.io, Implementation of structured metadata (e.g., FAQ schema, article metadata, canonical URLs), TL;DR summaries or answer-first formatting added to key documentation and product pages, Deep-linked, self-contained concept pages created or refactored for LLM usability, Improved search visibility and AI result representation (tracked via baseline comparison)
- Recommended Skills: Basic web development (HTML, Markdown, GitHub-based sites), Understanding of SEO fundamentals, Interest in AI, answer engines, or technical documentation, Familiarity with static site generators

### Kubernetes

#### Graduate the kubeadm feature gate ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode to GA

- Description: If the kubeadm feature gate ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode
is enabled, it tells the kubelet on a control plane node to communicate only with
the local kube-apiserver running on the same node. If it is not enabled, the kubelets
can try to reach out to a leading kube-apiserver trough the load balancer sitting
in front of all control plane nodes. This can violate the Kubernetes version
skew policy between kubelet and kube-apiserver during upgrade scenarios, leading
to potential component failures. By graduating the feature gate to GA, kubeadm will
ensure such policy violation scenarios are avoided. 
- Expected Outcome: The feature gate is graduated to GA
- Recommended Skills: golang, Kubernetes, kubeadm

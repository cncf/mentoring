## Proposed Project ideas

### Kagent

#### Building cloud native agents for Kagent

- Description: Kagent is an open-source framework for DevOps and platform engineers to run AI agents in Kubernetes, automating complex operations and troubleshooting tasks. We have a few agents for kagents (Kubernetes, Istio, Cilium, Argo, Prometheus, Grafana etc) and would love to build more agents for other CNCF graduated or incubation projects so users can use conversation style to chat with the agents to either learn or troubleshooting or operating these projects.
  
- Expected Outcome: Able to build at least 2-3 agents for CNCF graduated or incubation projects. Able to write a blog for the work and produce associated docs as well.
  
- Recommended Skills:
  - Python
  - Kubernetes
  - familar with cloud native, Docker and some CNCF graduated or incubation projects
  - Basic understanding of AI agents and LLMs.
  - Understand how open source contribution works, familar with GitHub.

### OpenCost

#### Develop MCP Server for Agentic AI interaction with OpenCost

- Description: We would like OpenCost to more effectively integrate with AI agents. To do this, we need to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to surface the information from the OpenCost API. This is a great opportunity to learn about MCP servers, and help us build an interface for AI agents to obtain reliable cost/usage information so that they can accomplish their business goals. 
- Expected Outcome: We would like an MCP server integrated into OpenCost. This MCP server should support queries on allocations, assets, and cloud costs. The MCP server should support the full range of allocations, assets, and cloud cost query parameters. A demo video should be recorded showing an interaction with the MCP server, and used to obtain costing information in a conversational setting. In addition, integration tests must be created in the OpenCost Integration Tests repo that test all interactions with the MCP server
- Recommended Skills: Golang, MCP, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, AI agent interfacing and usage, documentation writing

  - Matt Bolt (@Mbolt35, matthew.bolt@ibm.com)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/opencost/opencost/issues/3239

####  OpenCost Data Model 2.0

- Description: OpenCost's data model is now 6 years old, and we have learned a great deal long the way. Based on these learnings, we would like to revamp how OpenCost represents its cost and usage data across the stack. We want to set OpenCost up for the next set of features and scale by building a solid foundation for the way we represent data. 
- Expected Outcome: We would make the UID of Kubernetes objects into a first class citizen. These UID based objects would then be grouped in a similar hierarchy to the way Kubernetes itself is organized. A successful conclusion of this project would see an additional emitter implemented in OpenCost, that emits data objects stored in compressed protobuf which reflect a hierarchy of Kubernetes objects. The mentors will help establish this hierarchy. This hierarchy should then be tested via integration tests against the existing objects, and key metrics compared to be equal across those. 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Object Oriented Design, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, Protobuf, Compression, Prometheus, documentation writing

### Prometheus

#### Prototyping Prometheus for exploratory use cases

- Description: Through a LFX Mentorship done in March-May, we performed [UX research](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/15909) focusing on different ways Prometheus could deal with OpenTelemetry's Resource Attributes. One of the insights that this research showed us is that Prometheus and OpenTelemetry were primarily designed for different use-cases. While Prometheus focuses on monitoring metrics that the user knows that exist, one of OpenTelemetry's goals is to enable exploration of your data while the user doesn't really know what he/she is looking for. This mentorship will take the next steps on those research findings, exploring ideas about how Prometheus can enable the "Exploration" use case. 
- Expected Outcome:
    - Two or more sets of wireframes based on ideation workshop
    - Spoken presentation and report summarizing the findings and deliverables
    - Stretch goal: Apply to present findings at an upcoming conference
- Recommended Skills:
    - Interest or currently working in UX Research and Design.
    - Familiarities with databases and querying.
    - Being comfortable to talk with End-Users in English.

But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to declare it stable, in terms of stability and performance in Prometheus, and general adoption from the wider Prometheus ecosystem.
- Expected Outcome: Since this is a large initiative, for this round of mentorship, we want to focus on the following tasks,
  - Add 2.0 support to compliance test; make it easy to test write and receive implementations.
  - Ensure RW new features works on agent mode (test for agent mode with metadata-wal-records and type-and-unit features).
  - Ensure Prometheus uses the official RW client

#### Podman Container Tools

##### Implement flushing of conntrack entries in Netavark on network changes

- Description:
  This project will involve implementing conntrack entry clearing into Netavark, Podman's network management tool.
  Stale conntrack entries can cause network traffic to be dropped if a UDP port is rebound while a container is running.
  Netavark is written in Rust, but the Rust netlink bindings (located [here](https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-netfilter)) presently do not include support for Conntrack.
  As such, the first step of the project will be to expand these bindings to cover Conntrack.
  Netavark can then make use of the bindings to flush Conntrack entries on network change, and tests implemented to verify this functionality.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Rust bindings for Conntrack implemented in the [rust-netlink](https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-netfilter) library
  - Netavark modified to use these bindings to drop Conntrack entries at appropriate times
  - Tests in Netavark repository to verify this functionality
- Recommended Skills:
  - Rust
  - Some C knowledge preferred
  - Basic networking - knowledge of IP addresses, ports, etc

### Kubernetes

#### Graduate the kubeadm feature gate ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode to GA

- Description: If the kubeadm feature gate ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode
is enabled, it tells the kubelet on a control plane node to communicate only with
the local kube-apiserver running on the same node. If it is not enabled, the kubelets
can try to reach out to a leading kube-apiserver trough the load balancer sitting
in front of all control plane nodes. This can violate the Kubernetes version
skew policy between kubelet and kube-apiserver during upgrade scenarios, leading
to potential component failures. By graduating the feature gate to GA, kubeadm will
ensure such policy violation scenarios are avoided. 
- Expected Outcome: The feature gate is graduated to GA
- Recommended Skills: golang, Kubernetes, kubeadm
- Mentor(s):
  - Shida Qiu (@SataQiu)
  - Paco Xu (@pacoxu)
- Type: maintainer mentorship (only for maintainers to work on as part of a one-off LFX Project)

### CloudNativePG

#### Rebuilding CloudNativePG Documentation for Multi-Version Support with Docusaurus

- Description: The current documentation of CloudNativePG (a Kubernetes-native
  Postgres operator) is statically built using `mkdocs` from Markdown sources,
  which must live with the rest of the source code as they are part of it. We
  want to modernise this process and introduce multi-version support, helping
  users find accurate information for the version they are running in production.
  This project aims to rebuild the documentation site using Docusaurus
  (preferred) or an equivalent static site generator to enable multi-version
  documentation and version selection. Additionally, any initiatives that improve
  content structure, navigation, searchability, and clarity are welcome, provided
  they enhance logical flow and maintainability while aligning with CNCF and user
  expectations. The documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages under the
  CloudNativePG website domain.

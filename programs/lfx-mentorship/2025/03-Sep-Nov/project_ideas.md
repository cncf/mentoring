### Jaeger

#### Next-Generation Jaeger Demo with OpenTelemetry and OpenSearch (2025 Term 3)

Description: This project will create a Kubernetes deployment for the full stack: the OpenTelemetry Demo application, the Jaeger backend components (Collector, Query), and OpenSearch as a storage backend. The environment will be automatically redeployed weekly to ensure it is always fresh and to solve the problem of data retention. The entire stack will be hosted on a managed Kubernetes cluster (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) within an Oracle Cloud environment generously donated to the project.
Expected Outcome:
-A working, publicly accessible Jaeger demo featuring the OpenTelemetry Demo application, deployed on Oracle Cloud.
-Fully automated, weekly deployments using the existing Helm-based automation and GitHub Actions.
-The entire environment defined as "Configuration as Code".
-A secure deployment following best practices for public-facing services.
-The UIs for Jaeger, the OTel Demo, the load generator, and OpenSearch Dashboards exposed -publicly via the existing demo.jaegertracing.io URL.
-Public-facing documentation on the Jaeger website explaining the demo architecture and linking to the automation code.
Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Cloud, Security, Monitoring

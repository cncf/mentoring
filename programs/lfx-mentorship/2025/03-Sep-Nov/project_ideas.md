## Proposed Project ideas

### Cilium

#### Evaluate SEO, AEO, and AIO for cilium.io

- Description: Improve how cilium.io content is discovered, ranked, and reused by search engines and AI tools. This includes enhancing technical SEO, optimizing for answer engines like Google SGE and Perplexity (AEO), and structuring content to be easily cited and used by large language models (AIO). The mentee will perform audits, recommend improvements, and implement changes across meta tags, structured data, documentation formatting, and content strategy.
- Expected Outcome: SEO, AEO, and AIO audit report for cilium.io, Implementation of structured metadata (e.g., FAQ schema, article metadata, canonical URLs), TL;DR summaries or answer-first formatting added to key documentation and product pages, Deep-linked, self-contained concept pages created or refactored for LLM usability, Improved search visibility and AI result representation (tracked via baseline comparison)
- Recommended Skills: Basic web development (HTML, Markdown, GitHub-based sites), Understanding of SEO fundamentals, Interest in AI, answer engines, or technical documentation, Familiarity with static site generators

### OpenCost

#### Develop MCP Server for Agentic AI interaction with OpenCost

- Description: We would like OpenCost to more effectively integrate with AI agents. To do this, we need to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to surface the information from the OpenCost API. This is a great opportunity to learn about MCP servers, and help us build an interface for AI agents to obtain reliable cost/usage information so that they can accomplish their business goals. 
- Expected Outcome: We would like an MCP server integrated into OpenCost. This MCP server should support queries on allocations, assets, and cloud costs. The MCP server should support the full range of allocations, assets, and cloud cost query parameters. A demo video should be recorded showing an interaction with the MCP server, and used to obtain costing information in a conversational setting. In addition, integration tests must be created in the OpenCost Integration Tests repo that test all interactions with the MCP server
- Recommended Skills: Golang, MCP, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, AI agent interfacing and usage, documentation writing

## Proposed Project ideas

### Knative

#### Enhancing the Knative func CLI Experience

- Description: Knative Functions enables you to easily create, build, and deploy stateless, event-driven functions as Knative Services by using the func CLI. With this LFX project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive UX evaluation of the func CLI. The focus will be on identifying usability issues, understanding developer workflows, and gathering structured feedback on CLI interactions. The findings will help improve the CLI's intuitiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction.
- Expected Outcome: A detailed analysis report documenting func CLIâ€™s usability findings, including (but not limited to ):
  - Assessment of CLI command organization, structure, and discoverability for new and experienced users
  - Review of help text quality and completeness across all commands
  - Mapping of common developer workflows with identified pain points
  - Evaluation of error handling and the user guidance during failures
  - Comparison with industry best practices for CLI design, with recommendations for closing identified gaps
- Recommended Skills: Experience with command-line interfaces, familiarity with UX evaluation/research methodologies, knowledge of cloud-native and Knative concepts, strong analytical, technical writing and documentation skills.

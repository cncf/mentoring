### Jaeger

#### Next-Generation Jaeger Demo with OpenTelemetry and OpenSearch (2025 Term 3)

- Description: This project will create a Kubernetes deployment for the full stack: the OpenTelemetry Demo application, the Jaeger backend components (Collector, Query), and OpenSearch as a storage backend. The environment will be automatically redeployed weekly to ensure it is always fresh and to solve the problem of data retention. The entire stack will be hosted on a managed Kubernetes cluster (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) within an Oracle Cloud environment generously donated to the project.

### OpenCost

#### Develop MCP Server for Agentic AI interaction with OpenCost

- Description: We would like OpenCost to more effectively integrate with AI agents. To do this, we need to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to surface the information from the OpenCost API. This is a great opportunity to learn about MCP servers, and help us build an interface for AI agents to obtain reliable cost/usage information so that they can accomplish their business goals. 
- Expected Outcome: We would like an MCP server integrated into OpenCost. This MCP server should support queries on allocations, assets, and cloud costs. The MCP server should support the full range of allocations, assets, and cloud cost query parameters. A demo video should be recorded showing an interaction with the MCP server, and used to obtain costing information in a conversational setting. In addition, integration tests must be created in the OpenCost Integration Tests repo that test all interactions with the MCP server
- Recommended Skills: Golang, MCP, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, AI agent interfacing and usage, documentation writing

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/3a83e46e-b950-4c57-bfa1-4b44bdadfad6

####  OpenCost Data Model 2.0

- Description: OpenCost's data model is now 6 years old, and we have learned a great deal long the way. Based on these learnings, we would like to revamp how OpenCost represents its cost and usage data across the stack. We want to set OpenCost up for the next set of features and scale by building a solid foundation for the way we represent data. 
- Expected Outcome: We would make the UID of Kubernetes objects into a first class citizen. These UID based objects would then be grouped in a similar hierarchy to the way Kubernetes itself is organized. A successful conclusion of this project would see an additional emitter implemented in OpenCost, that emits data objects stored in compressed protobuf which reflect a hierarchy of Kubernetes objects. The mentors will help establish this hierarchy. This hierarchy should then be tested via integration tests against the existing objects, and key metrics compared to be equal across those. 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Object Oriented Design, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, Protobuf, Compression, Prometheus, documentation writing

### OpenTelemetry

#### Developing Guidelines for OTel Survey Analysis and Communication
- Description: Various special interest groups (a.k.a. SIGs) in the OpenTelemetry project run surveys to understand the experience of the end-users better. To run surveys efficiently, SIG End-user provides guidelines and assistance to people running surveys. In the past, SIG End-user focused on providing guidelines around survey design. Now we would like to move forward and cover survey data analysis and communication findings. 
- Expected Outcome: The mentee in this project will describe a step-by-step survey data analysis process and tools that OTel contributors without deep data analytics knowledge can leverage to analyze their survey data – from cleaning and coding of data, through descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, to visualization. In addition, the mentee will come up with suggestions on how to improve existing and/or propose new ways to communicate survey findings from surveys to the OpenTelemetry community. [Bonus] The mentee might also execute one survey to test out the guidelines.

### Prometheus

#### Prototyping Prometheus for exploratory use cases

- Description: Through a LFX Mentorship done in March-May, we performed [UX research](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/15909) focusing on different ways Prometheus could deal with OpenTelemetry's Resource Attributes. One of the insights that this research showed us is that Prometheus and OpenTelemetry were primarily designed for different use-cases. While Prometheus focuses on monitoring metrics that the user knows that exist, one of OpenTelemetry's goals is to enable exploration of your data while the user doesn't really know what he/she is looking for. This mentorship will take the next steps on those research findings, exploring ideas about how Prometheus can enable the "Exploration" use case. 
- Expected Outcome:
    - Two or more sets of wireframes based on ideation workshop
    - Spoken presentation and report summarizing the findings and deliverables
    - Stretch goal: Apply to present findings at an upcoming conference
- Recommended Skills:
    - Interest or currently working in UX Research and Design.
    - Familiarities with databases and querying.
    - Being comfortable to talk with End-Users in English.

#### Prometheus Remote Write 2.0 stability

- Description: In the past few quarters, a lot of work has gone into the new Remote Write 2.0 (PROM-35) proposal, and a new spec has been successfully established https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/prw/remote_write_spec_2_0/. But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to declare it stable, in terms of stability and performance in Prometheus, and general adoption from the wider Prometheus ecosystem.
- Expected Outcome: Since this is a large initiative, for this round of mentorship, we want to focus on the following tasks,
  - Add 2.0 support to compliance test; make it easy to test write and receive implementations.
  - Ensure RW new features works on agent mode (test for agent mode with metadata-wal-records and type-and-unit features).
  - Ensure Prometheus uses the official RW client
- Recommended Skills: Go, Prometheus

#### Prometheus Native Summaries

- Description: Prometheus Summaries are less but still widely used metric type. Currently, similar to classic histogram, a single summary is composed of multiple counter series. The native summary idea proposes to structure the summary type metric samples into a complex sample, similar to native histograms. As a result, bringing meanigful storage efficiency and transactionality gains. This project offers an opportunity to introduce relatively complex database change across Prometheus scraping, WAL, TSDB and querying; considering the precedense of native histograms. This project will allow mentee to learn about Prometheus, generally database internals as well as observabvility needs.
- Expected Outcome: The proposal and demo Prometheus implementation is published.

#### Podman Container Tools

##### Implement flushing of conntrack entries in Netavark on network changes

- Description:
  This project will involve implementing conntrack entry clearing into Netavark, Podman's network management tool.
  Stale conntrack entries can cause network traffic to be dropped if a UDP port is rebound while a container is running.
  Netavark is written in Rust, but the Rust netlink bindings (located [here](https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-netfilter)) presently do not include support for Conntrack.
  As such, the first step of the project will be to expand these bindings to cover Conntrack.
  Netavark can then make use of the bindings to flush Conntrack entries on network change, and tests implemented to verify this functionality.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Rust bindings for Conntrack implemented in the [rust-netlink](https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-netfilter) library
  - Netavark modified to use these bindings to drop Conntrack entries at appropriate times
  - Tests in Netavark repository to verify this functionality
- Recommended Skills:
  - Rust
  - Some C knowledge preferred
  - Basic networking - knowledge of IP addresses, ports, etc

### Cartography

#### IAM Whatever You Say IAM - GCP and Azure edition

Implement Resource Permission Relationships for GCP and Azure

- Description:
Want to be a cloud hacker?

In the cloud, answering the question "who has access to what" is surprisingly complex: we need to know what identities exist, what permission policies and controls apply to them, what resources (storage, compute, networking) exist, what permissions apply to those, and we need to tie those together. [Cartography](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography) is an ambitious open source project that aims to do just that.

In this project, our goal is to model and map cloud IAM relationships in GCP and Azure so users can answer “who can access what resources” across multi-cloud environments.

We previously did this in AWS as seen in [“IAM: Whatever You Say I Am”](https://eng.lyft.com/iam-whatever-you-say-iam-febce59d1e3b), and we would love to complete our coverage of this across the major cloud providers.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement support for evaluating permission objects in GCP and Azure to draw paths such as `(:GCPUser)-[:CAN_READ]->(:GCPBucket)` or `(:AzureServicePrincipal)-[:CAN_READ]->(:StorageAccount)`.
  - Bonus: opportunity to author or co-author a blog post or video demo

- Recommended Skills:
  - Python
  - Ability to handle feedback gracefully is required
  - Familiarity with cloud security permissions and interest in information security strongly preferred
  - Familiarity with cloud IAM (GCP or Azure or AWS)
  - Strong written and verbal communication skills in English required
  - Basic Neo4j/Cypher knowledge a plus but not necessary

#### Make map of Azure and Google Compute Cloud resources

Vibe-code your way to making the world's most complete infra map.

- Description:
[Cartography](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography) makes maps of the cloud so that security and devops teams can find and fix problems. Think about it like the [Maurauder's Map](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map) from Harry Potter.

Cartography has very good AWS coverage, but lacks support for many Azure and GCP resources. With your help, we can fix this! Companies around the world use Cartography to better understand their infra, and you can be a part of this. Most of these modules should be conducive to coding with agents (we have a well-documented [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/AGENTS.md)!), so if you enjoy writing in Python, want to learn about information security/devops, and moving fast, this is the project for you.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement graph schemas for missing Azure and AWS objects in Cartography

### KubeSlice

#### Implement Dynamic IPAM for the Slice Overlay Network

- Description:  In the current KubeSlice design, IP address management (IPAM) for slice overlay networks is static and inefficient. A predefined CIDR block (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16) is divided into a fixed number of subnets regardless of how many clusters participate in the slice, leading to significant IP space wastage.  
  This project aims to implement a dynamic IPAM system that allocates IP subnets to clusters on demand and reclaims unused ranges when clusters leave the slice. It will ensure efficient address utilization, synchronization across clusters, and integration with the KubeSlice control plane.

- Expected Outcome:
    - A dynamic IPAM allocator integrated with the KubeSlice controller or sidecar component.
    - Support for on-demand IP allocation and subnet reclamation when clusters join or leave a slice.
    - Conflict resolution and state synchronization across clusters using CRDs or distributed storage.
    - Documentation on how the system works, configuration options, and edge case behaviour.

- Recommended Skills:  
  Go (Golang), Kubernetes controllers and CRDs, IPAM concepts, networking (CIDRs, subnets).

#### Implement Custom Topology Definition for a Slice

- Description:  KubeSlice currently uses a full-mesh topology for the slice overlay network, where every cluster connects to every other cluster in the slice. This results in unnecessary tunnel creation and resource consumption.  
  This project proposes a topology-aware design, allowing users to define custom connectivity matrices for slices. Users can specify partial meshes. Additionally, the project will support configuring each cluster's VPN deployment type (client/server) to accommodate network constraints such as firewalls or NAT.

- Expected Outcome:
    - Extension of the Slice CRD to support custom topology and VPN role definitions.
    - Logic to establish tunnels based only on the defined connectivity matrix.
    - Support for various deployment topologies (full-mesh, partial mesh, hub-spoke).
    - Sample configurations and documentation on how to define and validate topologies.

- Recommended Skills:  
  Go (Golang), Kubernetes CRDs and controllers, VPN networking concepts (client/server), overlay networking.

#### Comprehensive Example Restoration for KubeEdge Ianvs

- Description: Ianvs serves as KubeEdge SIG AI distributed benchmark toolkit. As more and more contributors running, KubeEdge Ianvs now has 25 examples and the number is still increasing. KubeEdge Ianvs then faces mounting usability issues due to dependency evolution and validation mechanisms. As Python versions, third-party libraries, and Ianvs features advance, partial historical examples fail to execute. This has led to surging user-reported Issues from confused contributors, untested PRs breaking core functionality of legacy features, severely outdated documentation misaligning with actual capabilities. Without systematic intervention, the example risks becoming obsolete for edge-AI developers and especially newcomers. We then try to resurrect Ianvs’ usability with comprehensive example restoration.

#### Device Anomaly Detection Framework Based on KubeEdge

- Description: The current KubeEdge platform represents device states using three statuses: Desired, ObservedDesired, and Reported. The device states displayed on the platform are entirely reliant on the Mapper, which collects and reports data from the device side. However, due to limitations in the Mapper implementation, physical device malfunctions, network delays, and potential network attacks, the device states shown on the platform may not accurately reflect the actual state of the devices. In the KubeEdge platform, if applications depend on device states for decision-making, such inconsistencies in state representation may lead to undesirable outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to design a device state anomaly detection framework for KubeEdge. By exploring the causal relationships among device states, the framework will establish lightweight anomaly detection capabilities and provide a comprehensive toolchain encompassing data collection, model training, real-time anomaly detection, and results visualization.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A general-purpose device anomaly detection framework that supports user-defined detection algorithms
  - A complete technical design document including model selection, training procedures, and detailed architecture diagrams for both training and online detection components
  - A machine learning model and corresponding anomaly detection algorithm capable of capturing causal relationships among device states, trained and tested using standard frameworks
  - An online anomaly detection module integrated into the KubeEdge device state reporting workflow, enabling real-time analysis through a model inference hook
- Recommended Skills: KubeEdge, IoT, Machine Learning

### Harbor

#### Harbor CLI - System Settings and Configuration

- Description: Harbor is a widely adopted container registry, and its initial CLI has been developed by LFX mentees. The goal is to extend this CLI by implementing additional functionalities and workflows that are currently only available in the Web UI. The CLI should be useful for Harbor administrators and users, especially to manage workflows within CI/CD pipelines. We seek a Golang-experienced mentee to enhance the CLI independently.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Extend the Harbor CLI to include essential commands not yet implemented.
  - Add new features to improve Harbor management via the CLI for Harbor Administration, enabling robust workflows in CI/CD environments.
  - Review and test all implemented commands to ensure they work as expected.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, spf13/cobra, Harbor

#### Extend Harbor's Pluggable Scanner API for Runtime Behavior Profiles

- Description: Harbor is a widely adopted container registry. As one of the most widely adopted container registries, it is a critical component in modern software supply chains. This project aims to enhance its security capabilities by extending Harbor's Pluggable Scanner specification to support Runtime Behavior Profiles (also known as a Behavior of Bill, or "BoB"). While Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) describe what an artifact *contains*, a BoB describes how it *behaves* at runtime. By integrating `kubescape-node-agent` as a scanner, Harbor will be able to retrieve, store, and display these runtime profiles for OCI artifacts. This allows software producers to ship secure-by-default configurations and provides consumers with a way to verify runtime behavior, detect anomalies, and report unexpected activity. This feature will create greater trust in artifacts and help users meet emerging compliance requirements, such as the EU's CyberResilience Act, by enabling active breach identification through anomaly detection.

- Expected Outcome:
  * Propose and document the minimally necessary modifications to the Harbor Pluggable Scanner Spec to support the retrieval of runtime profiles.
  * Implement a scanner adapter that integrates `kubescape-node-agent` with Harbor.
  * The adapter must be able to retrieve and process SPDX-compliant Runtime Profiles (SBOBs).
  * Extend Harbor's UI to allow users to view runtime profiles and see potential mismatches between expected and observed behavior.
  * Lay the foundation for interoperability of runtime and supply chain security tooling across the CNCF ecosystem.

- Recommended Skills:
  * Golang
  * REST API Design
  * Kubernetes
  * Containers and OCI Image/Distribution Specifications
  * Familiarity with software supply chain security concepts (SBOM, SPDX)

#### Harbor Satellite: Implementing a Eventing System for Satellite

- Description:
  Harbor Satellite is a lightweight, OCI-compliant registry (currently based on Zot) designed to run on edge devices, such as Raspberry Pi or ARM-based hardware. It acts as a local container registry for edge devices and workloads. The satellite autonomously fetches configuration and state, registers with Ground Control, reports its status, and optionally sends system-level events to connected edge systems.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Implement an eventing mechanism to notify edge systems about critical state transitions (e.g., "state update ready", "sync complete").
  - Improve build and release pipelines.
  - Make the satellite functional on ARM-based edge devices (like Raspberry Pi).
  - Add reliable state and health reporting back to Ground Control.
  - Add e2e tests to validate artifact fetching, status reporting, and eventing.

- Recommended Skills
  - Golang
  - Containers
  - Edge Computing
  - OCI Image/Distribution Spec
  - Webhooks
  - Event-Driven Architecture

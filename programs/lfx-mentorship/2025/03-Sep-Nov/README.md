### OpenCost

#### Develop MCP Server for Agentic AI interaction with OpenCost

- Description: We would like OpenCost to more effectively integrate with AI agents. To do this, we need to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to surface the information from the OpenCost API. This is a great opportunity to learn about MCP servers, and help us build an interface for AI agents to obtain reliable cost/usage information so that they can accomplish their business goals. 
- Expected Outcome: We would like an MCP server integrated into OpenCost. This MCP server should support queries on allocations, assets, and cloud costs. The MCP server should support the full range of allocations, assets, and cloud cost query parameters. A demo video should be recorded showing an interaction with the MCP server, and used to obtain costing information in a conversational setting. In addition, integration tests must be created in the OpenCost Integration Tests repo that test all interactions with the MCP server
- Recommended Skills: Golang, MCP, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, AI agent interfacing and usage, documentation writing

####  OpenCost Data Model 2.0

- Description: OpenCost's data model is now 6 years old, and we have learned a great deal long the way. Based on these learnings, we would like to revamp how OpenCost represents its cost and usage data across the stack. We want to set OpenCost up for the next set of features and scale by building a solid foundation for the way we represent data. 
- Expected Outcome: We would make the UID of Kubernetes objects into a first class citizen. These UID based objects would then be grouped in a similar hierarchy to the way Kubernetes itself is organized. A successful conclusion of this project would see an additional emitter implemented in OpenCost, that emits data objects stored in compressed protobuf which reflect a hierarchy of Kubernetes objects. The mentors will help establish this hierarchy. This hierarchy should then be tested via integration tests against the existing objects, and key metrics compared to be equal across those. 
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Object Oriented Design, Comfort with OpenCost, Cost/Usage reporting, Protobuf, Compression, Prometheus, documentation writing

To run surveys efficiently, SIG End-user provides guidelines and assistance to people running surveys. In the past, SIG End-user focused on providing guidelines around survey design. Now we would like to move forward and cover survey data analysis and communication findings. 
- Expected Outcome: The mentee in this project will describe a step-by-step survey data analysis process and tools that OTel contributors without deep data analytics knowledge can leverage to analyze their survey data – from cleaning and coding of data, through descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, to visualization. In addition, the mentee will come up with suggestions on how to improve existing and/or propose new ways to communicate survey findings from surveys to the OpenTelemetry community. [Bonus] The mentee might also execute one survey to test out the guidelines.

#### Implement KubeStellar controller logic to map WECs resources status to READY state of corresponding resource definitions in WDSes

- Description:  
  This project aims to enhance the KubeStellar controller to reflect the readiness status of WEC resources in their corresponding WDS resource definitions. Currently, users must inspect status objects manually to determine propagation and readiness. This improvement is especially useful for tools like Argo CD, which rely on accurate READY status to show resources as synced.

- Expected Outcome:  
  - Design an efficient architecture to map the status of WEC resources back to their originating WDS resource.
  - Implement the controller logic to update WDS resource readiness based on the aggregated readiness of all corresponding WECs.
  - Ensure the updated WDS READY state integrates well with tools like Argo CD, showing accurate sync states.
  - Validate and demonstrate that resources in WDS appear correctly synced post implementation.

- Recommended Skills:  
  - Golang  
  - Kubernetes controllers and CRDs  
  - Distributed systems basics  
  - Familiarity with Argo CD (optional but preferred)

### Prometheus

#### Prototyping Prometheus for exploratory use cases

- Description: Through a LFX Mentorship done in March-May, we performed [UX research](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/15909) focusing on different ways Prometheus could deal with OpenTelemetry's Resource Attributes. One of the insights that this research showed us is that Prometheus and OpenTelemetry were primarily designed for different use-cases. While Prometheus focuses on monitoring metrics that the user knows that exist, one of OpenTelemetry's goals is to enable exploration of your data while the user doesn't really know what he/she is looking for. This mentorship will take the next steps on those research findings, exploring ideas about how Prometheus can enable the "Exploration" use case. 
- Expected Outcome:
    - Two or more sets of wireframes based on ideation workshop
    - Spoken presentation and report summarizing the findings and deliverables
    - Stretch goal: Apply to present findings at an upcoming conference
- Recommended Skills:
    - Interest or currently working in UX Research and Design.
    - Familiarities with databases and querying.
    - Being comfortable to talk with End-Users in English.

#### Prometheus Remote Write 2.0 stability

- Description: In the past few quarters, a lot of work has gone into the new Remote Write 2.0 (PROM-35) proposal, and a new spec has been successfully established https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/prw/remote_write_spec_2_0/. But there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to declare it stable, in terms of stability and performance in Prometheus, and general adoption from the wider Prometheus ecosystem.
- Expected Outcome: Since this is a large initiative, for this round of mentorship, we want to focus on the following tasks,
  - Add 2.0 support to compliance test; make it easy to test write and receive implementations.
  - Ensure RW new features works on agent mode (test for agent mode with metadata-wal-records and type-and-unit features).
  - Ensure Prometheus uses the official RW client
- Recommended Skills: Go, Prometheus

- Description: Prometheus Summaries are less but still widely used metric type. Currently, similar to classic histogram, a single summary is composed of multiple counter series. The native summary idea proposes to structure the summary type metric samples into a complex sample, similar to native histograms. As a result, bringing meanigful storage efficiency and transactionality gains. This project offers an opportunity to introduce relatively complex database change across Prometheus scraping, WAL, TSDB and querying; considering the precedense of native histograms. This project will allow mentee to learn about Prometheus, generally database internals as well as observabvility needs.
- Expected Outcome: The proposal and demo Prometheus implementation is published.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Prometheus

#### Podman Container Tools

##### Implement flushing of conntrack entries in Netavark on network changes

- Description:
  This project will involve implementing conntrack entry clearing into Netavark, Podman's network management tool.
  Stale conntrack entries can cause network traffic to be dropped if a UDP port is rebound while a container is running.
  Netavark is written in Rust, but the Rust netlink bindings (located [here](https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-netfilter)) presently do not include support for Conntrack.
  As such, the first step of the project will be to expand these bindings to cover Conntrack.
  Netavark can then make use of the bindings to flush Conntrack entries on network change, and tests implemented to verify this functionality.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Rust bindings for Conntrack implemented in the [rust-netlink](https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-netfilter) library
  - Netavark modified to use these bindings to drop Conntrack entries at appropriate times
  - Tests in Netavark repository to verify this functionality
- Recommended Skills:
  - Rust
  - Some C knowledge preferred
  - Basic networking - knowledge of IP addresses, ports, etc

### Cartography

#### IAM Whatever You Say IAM - GCP and Azure edition

Implement Resource Permission Relationships for GCP and Azure

- Description:
Want to be a cloud hacker?

In the cloud, answering the question "who has access to what" is surprisingly complex: we need to know what identities exist, what permission policies and controls apply to them, what resources (storage, compute, networking) exist, what permissions apply to those, and we need to tie those together. [Cartography](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography) is an ambitious open source project that aims to do just that.

In this project, our goal is to model and map cloud IAM relationships in GCP and Azure so users can answer “who can access what resources” across multi-cloud environments.

We previously did this in AWS as seen in [“IAM: Whatever You Say I Am”](https://eng.lyft.com/iam-whatever-you-say-iam-febce59d1e3b), and we would love to complete our coverage of this across the major cloud providers.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement support for evaluating permission objects in GCP and Azure to draw paths such as `(:GCPUser)-[:CAN_READ]->(:GCPBucket)` or `(:AzureServicePrincipal)-[:CAN_READ]->(:StorageAccount)`.
  - Bonus: opportunity to author or co-author a blog post or video demo

- Recommended Skills:
  - Python
  - Ability to handle feedback gracefully is required
  - Familiarity with cloud security permissions and interest in information security strongly preferred
  - Familiarity with cloud IAM (GCP or Azure or AWS)
  - Strong written and verbal communication skills in English required
  - Basic Neo4j/Cypher knowledge a plus but not necessary

#### Make map of Azure and Google Compute Cloud resources

Vibe-code your way to making the world's most complete infra map.

- Description:
[Cartography](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography) makes maps of the cloud so that security and devops teams can find and fix problems. Think about it like the [Maurauder's Map](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map) from Harry Potter.

Cartography has very good AWS coverage, but lacks support for many Azure and GCP resources. With your help, we can fix this! Companies around the world use Cartography to better understand their infra, and you can be a part of this. Most of these modules should be conducive to coding with agents (we have a well-documented [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/AGENTS.md)!), so if you enjoy writing in Python, want to learn about information security/devops, and moving fast, this is the project for you.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Design and implement graph schemas for missing Azure and AWS objects in Cartography

### KubeSlice

#### Implement Dynamic IPAM for the Slice Overlay Network

- Description:  In the current KubeSlice design, IP address management (IPAM) for slice overlay networks is static and inefficient. A predefined CIDR block (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16) is divided into a fixed number of subnets regardless of how many clusters participate in the slice, leading to significant IP space wastage.  
  This project aims to implement a dynamic IPAM system that allocates IP subnets to clusters on demand and reclaims unused ranges when clusters leave the slice. It will ensure efficient address utilization, synchronization across clusters, and integration with the KubeSlice control plane.

- Expected Outcome:
    - A dynamic IPAM allocator integrated with the KubeSlice controller or sidecar component.
    - Support for on-demand IP allocation and subnet reclamation when clusters join or leave a slice.
    - Conflict resolution and state synchronization across clusters using CRDs or distributed storage.
    - Documentation on how the system works, configuration options, and edge case behaviour.

- Recommended Skills:  
  Go (Golang), Kubernetes controllers and CRDs, IPAM concepts, networking (CIDRs, subnets).

#### Implement Custom Topology Definition for a Slice

- Description:  KubeSlice currently uses a full-mesh topology for the slice overlay network, where every cluster connects to every other cluster in the slice. This results in unnecessary tunnel creation and resource consumption.  
  This project proposes a topology-aware design, allowing users to define custom connectivity matrices for slices. Users can specify partial meshes. Additionally, the project will support configuring each cluster's VPN deployment type (client/server) to accommodate network constraints such as firewalls or NAT.

- Expected Outcome:
    - Extension of the Slice CRD to support custom topology and VPN role definitions.
    - Logic to establish tunnels based only on the defined connectivity matrix.
    - Support for various deployment topologies (full-mesh, partial mesh, hub-spoke).
    - Sample configurations and documentation on how to define and validate topologies.

- Recommended Skills:  
  Go (Golang), Kubernetes CRDs and controllers, VPN networking concepts (client/server), overlay networking.

##### Support Namespaced CEL-Based Policies

- Description: Kyverno currently supports cluster-wide CEL-based policy types (ValidatingPolicy, MutatingPolicy, ImageValidatingPolicy, GeneratingPolicy, and DeletingPolicy), but lacks namespaced versions. This creates challenges for namespace owners who need to manage policies within their namespaces without requiring cluster-wide permissions. The goal of this project is to implement namespaced versions of all five CEL-based policy types to provide better RBAC control, security, and lifecycle management for namespace-scoped policy management.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Implement namespaced versions of all five CEL-based policy types:
  - Ensure proper RBAC integration for namespace-scoped policy management
  - Create comprehensive documentation and examples for namespaced policies
  - Write tests to validate namespaced policy functionality
- Recommended Skills:
  - Go programming language
  - Kubernetes API and admission controllers
  - CEL (Common Expression Language)
  - Kubernetes RBAC and security models
  - YAML/JSON configuration
  - Testing and documentation

#### Enhance Kyverno Documentation

- Description: Kyverno has evolved significantly with the introduction of new CEL-based policy types in the `v1alpha1` API version. The current documentation and website need to be updated to reflect these advancements and position Kyverno appropriately in the policy engine landscape. This project aims to enhance Kyverno's documentation, website content, and overall positioning to showcase the new capabilities while maintaining clear guidance for users transitioning from traditional policies to CEL-based formats.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Update and enhance Kyverno's website to reflect new CEL-based policy capabilities
  - Ensure comprehensive documentation for all new policy types
  - Update Kyverno's positioning in the policy engine ecosystem
  - Update comparison charts and feature matrices
  - Enhance user experience with better navigation and search functionality
  - Update API reference documentation with new policy types

#### kgateway, agentgateway, and observability improvements

- Description:
This project focuses on enhancing observability in kgateway’s agentgateway integration by adding support for OpenTelemetry-based tracing, exposing Prometheus-compatible metrics, and configuring access logging. It builds on a previous LFX project that introduced tracing support for kgateway’s AI extproc server, extending those capabilities to support span propagation from agentgateway. 

In addition to adding support for configuring the kgateway control plane to set agentgateway’s tracing configuration, we want to test exporting traces to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends such as the OpenTelemetry Collector and Jaeger, and create user-facing documentation for these integrations. 

Beyond emitting basic spans, this project will also document how to enrich traces with authenticated user context derived from RBAC decisions, enabling more fine-grained debugging and attribution.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Translate the existing tracing and access logging APIs in kgateway to enable configuring tracing for the kgateway’s agentgateway integration
  - Create end-to-end (e2e) tests to validate configuration and trace propagation
  - Raise issues for any gaps or friction points discovered during testing
  - Write documentation for plugin developers and end users
  - Writing user-facing documentation and blogs on Otel tracing with agentgateway and kgateway integration with OpenTelemetry-compatible backends
  - Gain hands-on experience with AI providers, OpenTelemetry, tracing platforms, MCP, a2a, Kubernetes, and kgateway while building real observability features!
  - Fun! 

- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - Rust
  - Otel
  - Kubernetes
  - Kubernetes Gateway API
  - (Bonus) Familiarity with MCP and/or A2A

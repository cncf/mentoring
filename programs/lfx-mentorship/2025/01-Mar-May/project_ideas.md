### CNCF Project Name: CNCF SIG Docs & Cloud Native Tooling


#### Mentorship project Title: Cloud Native Codex – A Searchable Command & Troubleshooting Guide

- **Description:**  
  Cloud engineers often forget exact commands for Kubernetes, Prometheus, Helm, Terraform, and other CNCF tools. **Cloud Native Codex** is an interactive **CLI tool and Web UI** that allows users to quickly search for:  
  - 🔍 **Essential cloud-native commands** (`kubectl`, `helm`, `docker`, `terraform`, etc.).  
  - 🛠️ **Troubleshooting solutions** for Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, and other CNCF tools.  
  - 📖 **Cheatsheets & best practices** to streamline cloud operations.  
  
  The goal is to **reduce troubleshooting time** by offering a **structured, interactive, and community-driven reference tool** for cloud-native engineers.
  
- **Expected Outcome:**  
  ✅ A fully functional **CLI tool** (`cloudcodex`) to search and retrieve commands in real-time.  
  ✅ An **interactive Web UI** where users can visually browse cloud-native commands.  
  ✅ A structured **knowledge base** for CNCF tools and debugging steps.  
  ✅ A **contribution model** for CNCF maintainers and community members to keep it updated.  

- **Recommended Skills:**  
  - Golang or Python (CLI Development)  
  - React + Next.js (Web UI)  
  - Markdown (Documentation)  
  - Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Docker (Command Database)  
  - Elasticsearch or SQLite (Searchable Data Storage)  

- **Mentor(s):**  
  - Goodness (@busybrainx99, ebohgoodness.t@gmail.com) – Lead Mentor  
  - Open to additional mentors with expertise in Golang, python, React, Next.js, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Cloud Native Tooling.

- **Upstream Issue:**  
  Could be linked to CNCF SIG Docs or existing Kubernetes documentation improvement efforts.

### **CLI Usage Example**
```bash
$ cloudcodex
> 🔍 Search: get Alertmanager config
------------------------------------
1. `kubectl get cm alertmanager-config -n monitoring -o yaml`
   📌 Gets the Alertmanager config file in Kubernetes.
2. `kubectl edit cm alertmanager-config -n monitoring`
   ✏️ Opens the Alertmanager config for editing.
------------------------------------
✅ Press [Enter] to copy the command.
```

```bash
$ cloudcodex
> 🔍 Search: list StatefulSets
------------------------------------
1. `kubectl get statefulsets -A`
   📌 Lists all StatefulSets across all namespaces.
2. `kubectl describe statefulset my-app -n default`
   📌 Shows detailed info for a specific StatefulSet.
------------------------------------
✅ Press [Enter] to copy the command.
```

### **Web UI Example**
🔎 **User searches:** `"kubectl get pods"`  
👀 **The UI displays:**  
- 🔹 **`kubectl get pods -A`** → Lists all pods in all namespaces.  
- 🔹 **`kubectl get pods -n my-namespace`** → Lists pods in a specific namespace.  
✅ Click to **copy** the command.  

### **Key Features:**  
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search & Autocomplete** – No need to remember exact syntax.  
- 📋 **One-Click Copy** – Press `Enter` to copy commands instantly.  
- 📖 **Command Explanations** – Short descriptions and real-world examples.  
- 🌐 **Web UI with Search & Filtering** – For quick browsing of commands.  
- 🛠️ **Offline Mode** – Local caching for instant access.  
- 🔄 **Live API-based Updates** – Keep commands fresh.  

### **Potential Future Enhancements:**  
🚀 **Voice Search** – "How do I restart a Kubernetes pod?"  
🔄 **Live Community Contributions** – Crowdsourced command updates.  
📚 **Integration with AI** – GPT-powered recommendations for related commands.  

### **Mentorship & CNCF Relevance:**  
Cloud Native Bible would improve **developer experience** by providing a **one-stop command lookup tool** for DevOps engineers, SREs, and cloud-native professionals. It aligns with CNCF’s mission to enhance documentation and tooling for cloud-native technologies.

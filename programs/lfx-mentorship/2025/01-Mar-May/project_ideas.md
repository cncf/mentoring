## Proposed Project ideas

### Envoy Gateway

#### Enhancing Envoy Gateway Documentation Using CNCF Tech Docs Analysis Framework

- Description: The **Envoy Gateway** project provides a simplified way to use **Envoy Proxy as an API Gateway**,
and its documentation is critical to enabling adoption, onboarding new users, and improving developer experience.
While the existing documentation covers core concepts and use cases, applying the **CNCF Tech Docs Analysis Framework**
will help assess and systematically enhance its **clarity, completeness, and usability**.

This project aims to evaluate and improve the [Envoy Gateway website and documentation](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io) by
leveraging the structured analysis methodology from the [CNCF Tech Docs Analysis Framework](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/blob/main/docs/analysis/howto.md).
The outcome will be a **comprehensive documentation improvement plan**, with targeted updates and best practices implemented.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Apply the **CNCF Tech Docs Analysis Framework** to assess Envoy Gateway docs
  - Identify gaps in **content, structure, readability, and technical accuracy**
  - Improve documentation **organization, navigation, and developer onboarding**
  - Optimize technical guides, examples, and API references
  - (Stretch Goal) Introduce best practices for **continuous documentation improvement**

- Recommended Skills:
  - Familiarity with **Envoy Proxy, Envoy Gateway, Kubernetes, and API Gateways** (or willingness to learn)
  - Experience with **Markdown, static site generators (e.g., Hugo), and GitHub-based workflows**
  - Interest in **developer experience, technical writing, and open-source documentation**
  - Ability to conduct structured **documentation analysis and usability improvements**

## Projects

### Antrea

#### Support L4 protocol filters in PacketCapture API

- Description: As a Kubernetes (K8s) network plugin (CNI plugin), Antrea provides networking functions for K8s Pods and includes various troubleshooting tools for cluster administrators and application developers to diagnose networking issues. The [PacketCapture feature](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/docs/packetcapture-guide.md) was introduced recently and allows capturing network traffic for specific endpoints using predefined filters similar to those supported by libpcap/tcpdump. Users can initiate a packet capture through a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) or a CLI command. The Antrea control plane then generates and injects the corresponding BPF program, and the captured packets can be exported as a pcap file. Currently, only a limited set of filters is supported. With this project, we aim to introduce additional filters, particularly Layer 4 protocol filters, such as TCP flags for the TCP transport protocol. These new filters will enable Antrea users to target network traffic more precisely.
- Expected Outcome: Extend the API definition for the PacketCapture CRD with additional filter fields, and implement the new API functionality by mapping the new fields to the corresponding BPF instructions. The new fields should also be exposed in the corresponding `antctl` CLI commands. The implementation should come with a sufficient amount of tests (both unit tests and e2e tests), ensuring that the new functionality is working as expected.
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, some knowledge about the K8s architecture and APIs, basic knowledge about networking protocols (IP/TCP/UDP/ICMP).

### Harbor

#### Harbor CLI

- Description: Harbor is a widely adopted container registry, and its initial CLI has been developed by LFX mentees. The goal is to extend this CLI by implementing additional functionalities and workflows that are currently only available in the Web UI. The CLI should be useful for Harbor administrators and users, especially to manage workflows within CI/CD pipelines. We seek a Golang-experienced mentee to enhance the CLI independently.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Extend the Harbor CLI to include essential commands not yet implemented.
  - Add new features to improve Harbor management via the CLI, enabling robust workflows in CI/CD environments.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, spf13/cobra

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/769b7e87-f2f5-4532-b247-392b1897ea50

#### Harbor Satellite

- Description: Containers have extended beyond their traditional cloud environments, becoming increasingly prevalent in remote and edge computing contexts. These environments often lack reliable internet connectivity, posing significant challenges in managing and running containerized applications due to difficulties in fetching container images. To address this, the project aims to decentralize container registries, making them more accessible to edge devices.
- Expected Outcome:
  The goal is to extend the proof of concept and demonstrate that such a solution practically works.
  Candidates should be able understanding and implementing the [image](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) and [distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
  to replicate images from a central registry to a registry on the edge location.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Container, Image-spec, Distribution-spec

### Headlamp (a Kubernetes UI)

#### Headlamp: Instrument with OpenTelemetry

- Description: Headlamp is a Kubernetes UI which is extensible. Having it instrumented with OpenTelemetry would allow those operating it to get information for debugging it when problems happen.
- Expected Outcome: Headlamp backend and frontend are instrumented so those that want to use OpenTelemetry when operating Headlamp can. There's documentation and a blog post with a demo video explaining how it's used.
- Recommended Skills: golang, TypeScript
- Mentor(s):
  - Rene Dudfield (@illume, renedudfield@microsoft.com)
  - Kautilya Tripathi (@knrt10, ktripathi@microsoft.com)
  - Santhosh Nagaraj (@yolossn, sannagaraj@microsoft.com)

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/d961bfc7-00e1-4c05-bf1a-f9c7ddf1756a

#### Headlamp: Make a Headlamp plugin for KEDA

- Description: Headlamp is a Kubernetes UI which is extensible. KEDA is a Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler. With KEDA, one can drive the scaling of any container in Kubernetes based on the number of events needing to be processed. While KEDA provides excellent functionality for scaling workloads based on event sources and custom metrics, monitoring and managing KEDA resources through Kubernetes dashboards remains challenging.
- Expected Outcome: Create a Headlamp plugin that provides comprehensive visibility and management capabilities for KEDA resources, enabling users to do the following. 1. View and manage ScaledObjects and ScaledJobs through a intuitive interface. 2. Monitor real-time scaling metrics and trigger states. 3. Troubleshoot scaling behaviors with integrated logging and event visualization.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, TypeScript. Kubernetes and KEDA too would be nice to have.

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/ceebb991-978f-4782-8435-195637f433aa

#### Headlamp: Build Plugin Installation Container

- Description: Headlamp is a Kubernetes UI which is extensible through plugins. Currently, plugin installation in Kubernetes environments requires manual intervention.  We need a containerized solution that can automatically install plugins during Headlamp's deployment using Kubernetes-native approaches like init containers and ConfigMaps.
- Expected Outcome:
  1. A containerized version of headlamp-plugin CLI that can be used as an init container
  2. Helm chart updates to support plugin installation via configuration
  3. Automated container builds as part of Headlamp's release process
  4. Documentation and examples showing how to use the plugin installer container
  5. Integration tests validating the plugin installation process
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, TypeScript, Shell scripting

### Inspektor Gadget

#### Building gadgets with Rust

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux
 hosts. A Gadget is an OCI image that includes one or more eBPF programs, metadata YAML file, and optionally, WASM modules for post processing. Today, Inspektor Gadget provides tooling to build gadgets from source code written in C (for the eBPF module) and Go (for the WASM module). This project is about adding support from building gadgets from Rust both for eBPF programs and for WASM modules.
- Expected Outcome: users can write their gadgets in Rust.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, Go, eBPF, WASM
- Mentor(s):
  - Mauricio Vasquez Bernal (@mauriciovasquezbernal, mauriciov@microsoft.com)
  - Francis Laniel (@eiffel-fl, flaniel@linux.microsoft.com)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/issues/3950
- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/42dd5a60-47f9-4f7c-b895-49ce6c81a59a

#### Implementing unit tests

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux hosts. A Gadget is an OCI image that includes one or more eBPF programs, metadata YAML file, and optionally, WASM modules for post processing. As OCI images, they use the same tooling as containers: building, pushing/pulling from OCI Registries.
Even though there are many integration tests, we wish to increase the coverage of unit tests for the majority of internal packages. These packages are essential, and a bad commit could lead to unseen disruptions. Debugging and diagnosing through integration tests is cumbersome and takes too much time.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Find out which packages are in most need of unit tests
  - Create a mock class/framework if needed
  - Implement unit tests
- Recommended Skills: Go
- Mentors:

#### Inspekting and analysing gadgets

- Description: Inspektor Gadget is an eBPF tool and systems inspection framework for Kubernetes, containers and Linux
 hosts. A Gadget is an OCI image that includes one or more eBPF programs, metadata YAML file, and optionally, WASM modules for post processing. As OCI images, they use the same tooling as containers: building, pushing/pulling from OCI Registries. But today, Inspektor Gadget does not have good tooling for inspecting a gadget: the `ig image inspect` command just gives the gadget name, digest and creation date without further details.
- Expected Outcome: the `ig image inspect` command tells the architectures supported by the gadget, the layers included in the OCI image, the data sources with their fields, the eBPF parameters. Additionally, inspecting the eBPF module can provide the ELF sections, the eBPF maps and the disassembled eBPF bytecode annotated with the source when available.
- Recommended Skills: Go, eBPF

### Istio

#### Support TLS for Istio metrics endpoints

- Description: [Istio](https://istio.io) extends Kubernetes to establish a programmable, application-aware network. Working with both Kubernetes and traditional workloads, Istio brings standard, universal traffic management, telemetry, and security to complex deployments

Istio does not support HTTPs based metric scraping for control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar [metrics](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/prometheus/#tls-settings)

This could have some security related consequences:

- An attacker might find some sensitive information that they can use for their advantage. For example, Envoy /stats endpoint can be used to enumerate all upstream services in the cluster.
- In theory an attacker could masquerade the metrics endpoint(s) and inject fake data to monitoring systems, in order to e.g. hide an ongoing attack, confuse the system to autoscale up/down etc.

It would be nice to protect the metrics endpoints with TLS, using mutual authentication. While this feature is a big one covering multiple components,
the easiest component alone is intended to be covered as part of this internship.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Implement HTTPS metrics for ztunnel component
  - Add unit tests and integration tests for the feature
  - Add documentation for the functionality
- Recommended Skills: Rust, Go, scripting, Kubernetes, Istio Ambient basics.

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/9b1a1e87-2757-4f4f-aa58-49d55fc07b16 

#### Improve documentation build infrastructure

- Description: The build infrastructure for istio.io currently carries a complete archived copy of the site for each release of Istio.  These archived versions should be separated to their own branch, with only the supported versions published.  We should also separate out content which is not version-specific (e.g. the home page, news and blogs) so that only the latest version of this content is visible online.
- Expected Outcome: Updated publishing infrastructure for istio.io which separates evergreen content (home page, blogs) with versioned content (documentation).  Drop-downs per docs page allow switching between the supported versions.  
- Recommended Skills: Systems engineering, scripting, programming (Go/Bash), Hugo templating

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/2fe99eb2-abc3-454f-b80a-ffd336fa2788

#### Implement new site search

- Description: Up to four versions of Istio are supported at one time, and so the documentation for each must be available. Our current site search is outdated and needs to be replaced, so that the search content only exists in the site search, and only fresh content is available on google.com.
- Expected Outcome: Working site search on istio.io, which lets you search for content for the currently supported versions.
- Recommended Skills: Hugo, Systems engineering, scripting, programming (Bash/go), Hugo templating

### Jaeger

#### Jaeger: Upgrade Storage Backends to V2 Storage API

- Description: [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source, distributed tracing platform designed to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based systems. A critical component of Jaeger is its storage backends, where traces captured by Jaeger are stored. With the release of Jaeger v2 last year we introduced a new, more efficient Storage API v2. However, the existing backend implementations in Jaeger are still using v1 API that is only wrapped in the v2 adapter, which prevents them from benefiting from the new capabilities such as batch writes and result streaming. The objective of this project is to upgrade some (or all) backend implementations to use the Storage API v2 natively. Please refer to the upstream issue for more details.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Upgrade memory and Elasticsearch backends to use the Storage API v2 natively.
  - Bonus: upgrade Cassandra and Badger backends to use the Storage API v2 natively.
- Recommended Skills: Go, scripting, CI/CD, familiarity with Elasticsearch/Cassandra a plus but not required.

#### Upgrade charts and graphs in Jaeger UI

- Description: [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source, distributed tracing platform designed to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based systems. Jaeger UI pioneered many new visualizations for analyzing distributed traces. However, over time, it accumulated views that utilize different and sometimes deprecated viz libraries. The objective is to standardize charting / graphing libraries used in Jaeger UI, upgrade their dependencies, and add new visualization features. Please refer to the upstream issue for more details.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Jaeger UI is not using deprecated dependencies
  - Consistent look and feel of graphs
  - Bonus: side panel for details for a given node
  - Bonus: overlaying metrics on the graph (as edge annotations and node coloring to reflect health / error rates)
  - Bonus: varying node displays depending on the type of node and implementation language
- Recommended Skills: Javascript, Typescript, React, NPM, Vite.js

### Karmada

#### Karmada Self-Signed Certificate Content Standardization

- Description: In the existing [Karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada) architecture, each component should have its own unique certificates to ensure clear identity and security. Best practices dictate that each component's name be used as the Common Name (CN) in its certificate to facilitate identity differentiation. However, currently, all Karmada components share same identical certificate content, leading to confusion and potential security risks.
The objective of this project is to enhance the compliance of the Karmada certificate system by ensuring that each component possesses distinct certificates that reflect its identity. This will improve system security, reduce management complexity, and align with industry standards. This project aims to achieve the following standards:
  - Utilize a single CA certificate for the entire Karmada system.
  - Issue individual server certificates for each server component, using the component name as the CN.
  - Issue individual client certificates for each client component, using the component name as the CN, same client can use consistent certificate for different servers.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Complete the issuance of different certificates for 8 server components and import the certificate content into the corresponding certificate Secrets.
  - Complete the issuance of different certificates for 11 client components and import the certificate content into the corresponding certificate Secrets or Config Secrets.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Familiarity with Golang, Kubernetes, and Karmada.
  - Basic understanding of certificate management.

#### Implement multi-cluster management in the Karmada dashboard

- Description: The Karmada dashboard has already implemented the management of resources in the control plane. Apart from that, we hope to implement the management of resources in the member cluster: once users add Kubernetes resources and the corresponding policy resources on the control plane, they can switch to the corresponding member cluster seamlessly, check the status of Kubernetes resources in the specific member cluster. Kubernetes dashboard is one of the most popular single-cluster management tools, which uses client-go sdk to communicate with the apiserver to manage resources in the cluster. A great deal of client-go related logic can be extended to muli-cluster easily, due to the karmada-aggregated-apiserver component and the compatibility design between Kubernetes resource and Karmada resoruces. So we hope to combine the Kubernetes dashboard with the karmada-aggregated-apiserver component to implement multi-cluster management in the Karmada dashboard.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Proposal for multi-cluster management base on `karmada-aggregated-apiserver`.
  - Tools to lift Kubernetes dashboard with specific version into Karmada dashboard repo, and implement management of resources in member cluster based on `karmada-aggregated-apiserver`.
  - Typical ui for member-cluster management:
    - list/detail/delete/update action for `deployment` resources.
    - log viewer for `pod`.
    - web terminal for `pod`，which user can attach the running pod, and execute tempory commands.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, Go, gin, react, webgl

#### KPM & LSP Integrated

- Description: Sometimes users will edit the `kcl.mod` file in the IDE to update project dependencies. The integration between LSP and KPM needs to be strengthened, it mainly includes two parts of functions. 
  - According to the content written by the user in the kcl.mod file, the IDE automatically calls the `kcl run/mod add/mod metadata` and other functions, and feeds back the results in the IDE. 
  - According to the user's operations in the command line, the changes of `kcl.mod` and project content are synchronized to the IDE.

examples:

1. When users update kcl.mod in the IDE, the required dependencies are automatically downloaded.

2. When users use the kpm tool to update dependencies, the IDE can be updated (recompiled). For example
```kcl
import k8s  # Error: Module not found
```

use `kcl mod add k8s` to download the dependency `k8s`.

kpm will download the k8s package and then the IDE errors will be eliminated

- Expected Outcome: 
  - Complete at least the following parts:
    - IDE triggers automatic dependencies updates of package management tools.
    - Automatic synchronization of kcl.mod files.
    - IDE users actively trigger dependency downloads, it looks like: a button or link for user to download the missing dependencies.
    - After the dependency update is complete, the IDE triggers a recompile to clear the error
- Recommended Skills: Go, Rust

#### Kmesh eBPF unit test

- Description: As the community features continue to expand, the number of eBPF programs in the data plane has increased. Due to the inherent limitations of eBPF (third-state encoding, neither user space nor kernel space, running in a kernel virtual machine with a dedicated instruction set), Kmesh implements complex governance logic through features like tail call and map-in-map, which poses challenges for data plane quality protection.
eBPF, a recently introduced programmable technology in the kernel, currently has an immature ecosystem. The industry is actively exploring eBPF testing capabilities (e.g., Unit Testing eBPF). This project aims to develop an eBPF UT testing framework in conjunction with the Kmesh project to ensure the quality of the Kmesh data plane.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Export Kmesh eBPF programs to support UT test case.
  - Export design documentation for eBPF UT tests

### KubeArmor

#### Providing Zero-Trust policies for popular workloads

- Description: KubeArmor can whitelist processes and assets based on set of rules provided through the policies. This feature allows KubeArmor to achieve zero trust for a workload. However, knowing the allowed behaviour for a workload and manually creating these policies is a pain. Therefore we want to provide Zero-trust policies for popular workloads like grafana, WordPress, redis, etc. (let's say some 100 workloads). We want to make these Zero-Trust policies available as artifacts.
  
- Expected Outcome: Create a registry of policies that allow users to seamlessly fetch and apply policies for popular workloads.

- Extended Goal: Since applications will have newer versions and the existing Zero-Trust policies may not work as expected. We can have an automated system to generate these Zero-Trust policies and so we can also automate the process of generating Zero-Trust policies for every version available or newer versions as well.
  
- Recommended Skills: familiarity with Golang, K8s CRD(Custom Resource Definition), YAML.

### Volcano

#### Volcano supports queue-level scheduling policies

- Description: Volcano supports unified scheduling of online and offline workloads, provides a wealth of scheduling plugins and algorithms, and can distinguish different tenants through queue distinction. The current scheduling policy is a global configuration, and all jobs in the queue use the same scheduling policy, but in actual scenarios, different tenants may need to use different scheduling policies due to different usage scenarios. Therefore, volcano needs to support setting and using different scheduling policies at the queue level instead of using a globally unified scheduling policy.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A new field is added to the queue CRD, and users can set scheduling policies at the queue level.
  - Volcano scheduler implements different scheduling policies based on the queue in which the job is located.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, GO, Volcano

#### Coordinate descheduler and Volcano to support resource defragmentation

- Description: Volcano community has provided Volcano descheduler to support descheduling. Currently, load-aware rescheduling is supported. Resource fragmentation is a problem that users are more concerned about. Volcano needs to provide a resource defragmentation strategy based on the existing descheduler, and needs to ensure that the evicted pods can be rescheduled successfully, which requires the cooperation of the rescheduler and the scheduler to solve resource fragmentation and maximize resource utilization.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Implementing a resource defragmentation strategy based on Volcano descheduler.
  - The Volcano descheduler works in conjunction with the Volcano scheduler to ensure that evicted pods can be re-scheduled successfully.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, GO, Volcano

#### Volcano dashboard feature enhancements

- Description: Volcano dashboard is a volcano resource front-end display tool. Currently, it only supports viewing resources, and the resources displayed are limited. It needs to support viewing more resources, and supports operations such as creation and deletion.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Supports viewing resources other than volcano related resources.
  - Supports add, delete, modify and query resources such as queues and volcano jobs.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, React, Node, JS

### WasmEdge

#### Implement a new WasmEdge installer in Rust

- Description: Create a new tool in Rust that provides: Support cross-operating systems, including Linux(amd64 and aarch64), macOS(Intel models and Apple Silicon models), and Windows(amd64); Simplifies installation of the WasmEdge runtime and its plugins in a single tool called wasmedgeup; Automatically handles versioning, dependencies, OS/ARCH detection, and ensure the same user experience across operating systems and architectures. For more details, please refer to the upstream issue.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A Rust implemented installer in [wasmedgeup](https://github.com/WasmEdge/wasmedgeup).
  - A document to describe how to use.
  - A CI workflow to build and test on Linux(Ubuntu, Fedora), macOS, and Windows.

#### Implement component model's validator

- Description: The current validator of component model inside of WasmEdge only check nested module and ensure VM can run the nested modules without problem, but the validations from component model are mostly skipped.
- Expected Outcome:
  - One should create a workable (merged into upstream) implementation of validator by working on
  - `include/validator/validator_component.h`
  - `lib/validator/validator_component.cpp`
  - The visitor pattern are already setup.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Since component model proposal separate their validation spec, one should able to
    find requirements from https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/tree/main/design/mvp
  - Implements it in C++.

#### Improve the WasmEdge-based Rust coding assistant for inference-time scaling

- Description: In a [previous LFX mentorship project](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/3495), we have created an [LLM-based coding assistant grounded in Rust programming language skills](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaianet/learn-rust). We aim to further improve the Rust coding assistant by incorporating inference-time compute that utilizes the Rust compiler for feedback. One of the greatest advantages of Rust is its powerful and strict compiler, and the detailed error message generated by the compiler. The Rust compiler could give valuable feedbacks to code generating LLMs to improve the code quality.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Run a [Qwen Coder 2.5 LLM locally](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/tree/main/qwen-2.5-coder-7b-instruct) or access it via an API.
  - Create an LLM system prompt that describes the structure and key elements of a `cargo` project. It will guide the LLM to generate multiple files (artifacts) for a complete project.
  - Create a Python program to send user requests to the LLM and parse the generated result into locally cached files.
  - Use a local Rust compiler to build the generated project. Sends the error messages back to the LLM to re-generate.
  - Iterate until there is no more errors.
  - Build a web API for the Python program that takes OpenAI compatible requests and return OpenAI compatible results.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Rust
  - [LlamaEdge](https://llamaedge.com/docs/user-guide/llm/full-openai)
  - LLMs like ChatGPT
  - Coding assistant like GitHub Copilot

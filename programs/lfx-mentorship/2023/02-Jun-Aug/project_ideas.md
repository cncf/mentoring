## Proposed Project ideas

### Jaeger

#### Upgrade Jaeger's internal telemtery to OpenTelemetry

- Description: historically, the Jaeger backend used the OpenTracing API, with Jaeger's own Go SDK `jaeger-client-go`, for instrumenting its own internals for distributed tracing. Since Jaeger's SDKs have been deprecated, we want to upgrade the Jaeger backend to use the OpenTelemetry tracing API and SDK directly.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Replace the use of OpenTracing API with OpenTelemetry
  - Remove `jaeger-client-go` and `jaeger-lib` as dependencies
  - Remove `opentracing-go` and `opentracing-contrib/*` as dependencies
  - Switch to standard instrumentation libraries where available (e.g. for HTTP, gRPC)
  - Rethink/rework `crossdock` integration tests to test end-to-end flow with OpenTelemetry data
  - Publish a blog post on medium.com/jaegertracing documenting the experience
- Recommended Skills: Go
- Mentor(s): Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro, github@ysh.us)

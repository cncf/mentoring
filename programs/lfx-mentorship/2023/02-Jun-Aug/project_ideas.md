## Proposed Project ideas

### Meshery

#### OCI compatible Kubernetes ontology

- Description: Network topologies and graph databases go hand-in-hand. The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph. Deliverables (among other items):

- MeshModel capabilities browser
- Import/export of MeshModel models and components as OCI images
- augmentation of cuelang-based component generator

- Recommended Skills: cuelang, golang, OCI
- Mentor(s): Lee Calcote (@leecalcote, leecalcote@gmail.com)

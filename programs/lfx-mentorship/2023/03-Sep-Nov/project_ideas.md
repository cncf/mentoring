## Proposed Project ideas

### Armada

#### Build a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada

- Description: [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) is a way to bring a Kubernetes front end and allow for your execution environment to be something other than Kubernetes. We want to add a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada so we can allow for a k8 front end integration with Armada.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A provider for virtual-kubelet that allows integration of Armada with Virtual-Kubelet
- Recommend Skills: Go

## Proposed Project ideas

### Armada

#### Build a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada

- Description: [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) is a way to bring a Kubernetes front end and allow for your execution environment to be something other than Kubernetes. We want to add a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada so we can allow for a k8 front end integration with Armada.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A provider for virtual-kubelet that allows integration of Armada with Virtual-Kubelet
- Recommend Skills: Go

### Konveyor

#### Extend use-case of detecting deprecated Kubernetes API usage

- Description: [Konveyor](https://www.konveyor.io/) provides a [unified experience](https://github.com/konveyor/enhancements/tree/master/enhancements/unified_experience) of tools to help organizations modernize their applications at scale to Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. We are looking for help on extending a use-case of detecting usage of [deprecated and removed Kubernetes APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/) in applications.  This work will involve determining what API resources have been deprecated or removed in each version of Kubernetes and then building [Analyzer Rules](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) to be contributed to our [Rulesets repository](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets), curation or development of sample applications in Golang, Java, and YAML to aid test scenarios, and documentation to help show a guided walkthrough of this capability.  You can see the beginning of this use-case being addressed with a [sample rule](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/rule-example.yaml#L42-L45) in this [demo of analyzer-lsp](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/tree/main#quick-demo). The development environment is based on Golang and Kubernetes. A minikube instance will work well for local development on Linux or Mac systems.
- Expected Outcome:
  - [Rules](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) contributed to [konveyor/rulesets](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets) to detect usage of deprecated or removed Kubernetes APIs.  Coverage for YAML, Golang, and Java source code, addition of this scenario into the project's automated test suite, and documentation of a guided scenario showing usage of these rules via a curated set of application source code examples.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Basic understanding of interaction with Kubernetes via kubectl
  - Basic software development skills (command line, git)

## Proposed Project ideas

### Jaeger

#### Upgrade Jaeger UI to the latest version of React.js

- Description: Jaeger UI is built on React. While we are seemingly already on v18.x of React, the upgrade was not done across the board and some other dependencies are still lagging behind, e.g. `"@types/react": "16.8.7"`. It's also blocking upgrades of other dependencies. This project is likely to involve a substantial amount of code contribution, as certain upgrade require fixing the code to use the new APIs, and sometimes we may run into dependencies that are EOL and need to be replaced altogether.
- Expected Outcome: Ideal outcome is to have _all_ dependencies upgraded to the latest versions (with the help of @dependabot) and fix all deprecation warnings during the build. But incremental progress towards that goal is also acceptable.
- Recommended Skills: Javascript, Typescript, NPM, Yarn, Vite.js

#### Combine three distinct graph views in Jaeger UI into one

- Description: Jaeger UI provides several views to visualize service dependencies, also known as service topology maps. However, these views are using different drawing libraries, resulting in very different look & feel and inconsistent experience. One of the views is using a `plexus` library that was purposely built as part of Jaeger UI that provides rich capabilities for displaying graphs, which may be a good candidate for the other views.
- Expected Outcomes:
  - Remove the dependency on react-vis library (https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/issues/1597).
  - Use a single library for graph visualizations.
  - Provide consistent look and feel of different graph views.
- Recommended Skills: Javascript, Typescript, NPM, Yarn, Vite.js, web worker

#### Build official support in Jaeger for Elasticsearch 8

- Description: Jaeger has always supported Elasticsearch (ES) as an official backend. Unfortunately, the Go driver we are using, `olivere/elastic`, does not support ESv8 and not planning to release any new versions. Despite the licensing changes, Elasticsearch remains a popular choice and v8 support question often comes up. In this project we want to add official support for ESv8. However, we also want to take this opportunity to do a better alignment with the OpenTelemetry Collector, which already has an [ESv8 exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter), perhaps we can use it directly and minimize the amount of code.
- Expected Outcomes:
  - Use OTEL ESv8 exporter from Jaeger, if possible, otherwise build internal implementation
  - Stretch goal: use ES data as the source for Jaeger SPM views
- Recommended Skills: Go, Elasticsearch

### WasmEdge

#### Add matrix operations for OpenCVMini-Wasm-Plugin

- Description: [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) is a WebAssembly runtime that supports both interpreter and ahead-of-time modes. To expand its capabilities, WasmEdge provides a plugin system that helps people attach more existing software. OpenCVMini is one of them, intended to help users get a limited OpenCV interface. With this feature, AI inference will have more flexible helper functions for pre-processing and post-processing. In this mentorship, we aim to add more OpenCV capabilities to the WasmEdge environment.

#### Create a Rust crate for YOLO model

- Description:
  With [WASI-NN plugins](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/neural-networks-for-wasi), WasmEdge is well-suited for running AI applications. However, AI applications are more than just the model. The application must pre-process data (such as images, audio and video) into TFLite / PyTorch formats, and convert the inference results back into application data in post-processing. Here are some examples:

  * The [mediapipe-rs](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs) project provides a Rust SDK to build applications for the mediapipe AI models.
  * The [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) application is [compiled to Wasm and runs in WasmEdge](https://medium.com/@michaelyuan_88928/running-llama2-c-in-wasmedge-15291795c470) to generate text using the [llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) models.

  In this project, we would like to build a Rust SDK to support applications on the [YOLO models](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
- Expected Outcome:
  - A Rust SDK that implements the pre-processing and post-processing functions required for the YOLO models. Those functions are implemented in OpenCV and Python in the official YOLO release.
  - Both image and video inputs should be supported.
  - Examples and documentation should be provided.
- Recommended Skills:
  - OpenCV
  - Rust
  - Tensorflow / Pytorch

#### create a ffmpeg plugin

- Description:
  The [mediapipe-rs](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs) project provides a Rust SDK to support mediapipe AI models. The SDK provides utility functions to pre-process application data (such as images, audio and video) into TFLite / PyTorch formats, and convert the inference results back into application data. In order to accomplish this, the [mediapipe-rs](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs) project has made extensive use of the [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) library. It [compiles ffmpeg to Wasm](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs/blob/main/src/build.rs) and then builds it together with the application binary.

  However, the issue with this approach is that those Wasm-compiled ffmpeg functions are slow. We believe a better approach is to create a ffmpeg plugin for WasmEdge, and allow Wasm applications to call native ffmpeg functions as host functions.
- Expected Outcome:
  - The deliverables will be
    - A WasmEdge plugin for ffmpeg that is similar to the [WasmEdge OpenCV-mini plugin](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/master/plugins/wasmedge_opencvmini). That is to re-export ffmpeg functions in C style as plugin functions as covered in the [plugin developer guide](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/wasmedge-plugin-system).
    - A Rust SDK for Wasm programs to access ffmpeg functions in the plugin. Similar to the [WasmEdge OpenCV-mini SDK](https://github.com/second-state/opencvmini)
    - Refactor the mediapipe-rs project to use the ffmpeg plugin instead of compiling ffmpeg to Wasm.
  - We expect the deliverable will cover at least 80% of all ffmpeg functions, and have complete unit test and documentation coverage.
- Recommended Skills:
  - C/C++
  - ffmpeg
  - Rust
  - WebAssembly

### Thanos

#### Implement fan-out query observability in Thanos

- Description:
  In the previous mentorship sessions we added the foundation required for query observability in Thanos's new [promql-engine](https://github.com/thanos-io/promql-engine) and hooked it up in the UI. We now have the foundation to record telemetry from our query engine as well such as time consumed per operator.
  This project aims to expand on this and add more metadata to the query execution, both on the promql-engine operator tree level and Thanos Query `Select()` calls for fan-out query observability.
  Once we have this metadata, we would like to visualize it in the Query UI.
- Expected Outcome:
  The end goal is to have a query execution tree decorated with the metadata, collected during execution (ideally even visualized in the Thanos UI). This will help users to understand the performance implications of their PromQL queries and the bottlenecks in their Thanos Query setups.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - React.js with TypeScript

## Proposed Project ideas

### Armada

#### Build a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada

- Description: [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) is a way to bring a Kubernetes front end and allow for your execution environment to be something other than Kubernetes. We want to add a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada so we can allow for a k8 front end integration with Armada.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A provider for virtual-kubelet that allows integration of Armada with Virtual-Kubelet
- Recommend Skills: Go
- Mentor(s):
  - Kevin Hannon, @kannon92, kevin@gr-oss.io
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/issues/2702

### CRI-O

#### Add additional log drivers to conmon-rs

- Description: conmon-rs is a container monitor written in Rust, used by CRI-O to monitor a container's lifecycle. Part of its responsibilities is log forwarding--taking the output of the container and writing that output to various places. Currently, conmon-rs supports one format: the one required by the Kubernetes CRI. The goal of this proposal is to add new log formats from the list of standardized ones, like JSON, Splunk, Journald.
- Expected outcome: A JSON log driver and Journald log driver are added to conmon-rs. A stretch goal of adding a Splunk log driver is also within scope.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, familiarity with containers
- Mentor(s):
  - Peter Hunt, haircommander, pehunt@redhat.com
  - Sascha Grunert, saschagrunert, sgrunert@redhat.com
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/containers/conmon-rs/issues/1126

#### CRI stats KEP

- Description: [CRI stats KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2371) is an effort to take the container stats and metrics collection from cAdvisor and move it to the CRI implementations. CRI-O will soon have support for stats and metrics collected through CRI, but work needs to be done to verify and validate these fields, and make sure their collection is performant as possible.
- Expected outcome: A test suite verifying the correctness of CRI-O's stats and metrics collection, as well as data verifying performance regressions are minimal at worst.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with containers
- Mentor(s):
  - Peter Hunt, haircommander, pehunt@redhat.com
  - Sohan Kunkerkar, sohankunkerkar, skunkerk@redhat.com
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/7175

### Jaeger

#### Upgrade Jaeger UI to the latest version of React.js

- Description: Jaeger UI is built on React. While we are seemingly already on v18.x of React, the upgrade was not done across the board and some other dependencies are still lagging behind, e.g. `"@types/react": "16.8.7"`. It's also blocking upgrades of other dependencies. This project is likely to involve a substantial amount of code contribution, as certain upgrade require fixing the code to use the new APIs, and sometimes we may run into dependencies that are EOL and need to be replaced altogether.
- Expected Outcome: Ideal outcome is to have _all_ dependencies upgraded to the latest versions (with the help of @dependabot) and fix all deprecation warnings during the build. But incremental progress towards that goal is also acceptable.
- Recommended Skills: Javascript, Typescript, NPM, Yarn, Vite.js
- Mentor(s):
  - Yash Sharma (yashrsharma44@meta.com)
  - Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro, github@ysh.us)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/issues/998

#### Combine three distinct graph views in Jaeger UI into one

- Description: Jaeger UI provides several views to visualize service dependencies, also known as service topology maps. However, these views are using different drawing libraries, resulting in very different look & feel and inconsistent experience. One of the views is using a `plexus` library that was purposely built as part of Jaeger UI that provides rich capabilities for displaying graphs, which may be a good candidate for the other views.
- Expected Outcomes:
  - Remove the dependency on react-vis library (https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/issues/1597).
  - Use a single library for graph visualizations.
  - Provide consistent look and feel of different graph views.
- Recommended Skills: Javascript, Typescript, NPM, Yarn, Vite.js, web worker
- Mentor(s):
  - Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro, github@ysh.us)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/issues/1466

#### Build official support in Jaeger for Elasticsearch 8

- Description: Jaeger has always supported Elasticsearch (ES) as an official backend. Unfortunately, the Go driver we are using, `olivere/elastic`, does not support ESv8 and not planning to release any new versions. Despite the licensing changes, Elasticsearch remains a popular choice and v8 support question often comes up. In this project we want to add official support for ESv8. However, we also want to take this opportunity to do a better alignment with the OpenTelemetry Collector, which already has an [ESv8 exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter), perhaps we can use it directly and minimize the amount of code.
- Expected Outcomes:
  - Use OTEL ESv8 exporter from Jaeger, if possible, otherwise build internal implementation
  - Stretch goal: use ES data as the source for Jaeger SPM views
- Recommended Skills: Go, Elasticsearch

### Kubescape

#### Build an admission controller for Kubescape

- Description: [Kubescape](http://kubescape.io/) is a utility that can scan a Kubernetes cluster and report on its security posture. It can also scan individual workloads (e.g. YAML files) before they are applied. By creating a Kubescape admission controller, we will be able to combine the two, denying workloads into a cluster where it would reduce the security posture.
- Expected Outcome: The Kubescape application will be extended and packaged to operate as an admission controller inside a cluster. The controller will be well documented, safe to install, and instrumented with logging and telemetry data to be able to diagnose problems.

### WasmEdge

#### Add matrix operations for OpenCVMini-Wasm-Plugin

- Description: [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) is a WebAssembly runtime that supports both interpreter and ahead-of-time modes. To expand its capabilities, WasmEdge provides a plugin system that helps people attach more existing software. OpenCVMini is one of them, intended to help users get a limited OpenCV interface. With this feature, AI inference will have more flexible helper functions for pre-processing and post-processing. In this mentorship, we aim to add more OpenCV capabilities to the WasmEdge environment.

#### Support AOT mode in proxy-wasm

- Description: [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) is a WebAssembly runtime that supports both interpreter and ahead-of-time modes. For proxy-wasm support, WasmEdge only provides the interpreter mode currently. Such as the other runtimes, WasmEdge should be able to support the AOT mode for better performance. In this mentorship, the mentees will help the WasmEdge project to complete the AOT mode in proxy-wasm proposal and write the docs for examples of running with proxy-wasm.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Modify the Bazel file to include the LLVM dependency.
  - Modify the code to support running WASM in AOT mode.
  - Add the documentation of proxy-wasm in the WasmEdge docs repo.

#### Create a Rust crate for YOLO model

- Description:
  With [WASI-NN plugins](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/neural-networks-for-wasi), WasmEdge is well-suited for running AI applications. However, AI applications are more than just the model. The application must pre-process data (such as images, audio and video) into TFLite / PyTorch formats, and convert the inference results back into application data in post-processing. Here are some examples:

  * The [mediapipe-rs](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs) project provides a Rust SDK to build applications for the mediapipe AI models.
  * The [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) application is [compiled to Wasm and runs in WasmEdge](https://medium.com/@michaelyuan_88928/running-llama2-c-in-wasmedge-15291795c470) to generate text using the [llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) models.

  In this project, we would like to build a Rust SDK to support applications on the [YOLO models](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
- Expected Outcome:
  - A Rust SDK that implements the pre-processing and post-processing functions required for the YOLO models. Those functions are implemented in OpenCV and Python in the official YOLO release.
  - Both image and video inputs should be supported.
  - Examples and documentation should be provided.
- Recommended Skills:
  - OpenCV
  - Rust
  - Tensorflow / Pytorch
  - WebAssembly

#### create a ffmpeg plugin

- Description:
  The [mediapipe-rs](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs) project provides a Rust SDK to support mediapipe AI models. The SDK provides utility functions to pre-process application data (such as images, audio and video) into TFLite / PyTorch formats, and convert the inference results back into application data. In order to accomplish this, the [mediapipe-rs](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs) project has made extensive use of the [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) library. It [compiles ffmpeg to Wasm](https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs/blob/main/src/build.rs) and then builds it together with the application binary.

  However, the issue with this approach is that those Wasm-compiled ffmpeg functions are slow. We believe a better approach is to create a ffmpeg plugin for WasmEdge, and allow Wasm applications to call native ffmpeg functions as host functions.
- Expected Outcome:
  - The deliverables will be
    - A WasmEdge plugin for ffmpeg that is similar to the [WasmEdge OpenCV-mini plugin](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/master/plugins/wasmedge_opencvmini). That is to re-export ffmpeg functions in C style as plugin functions as covered in the [plugin developer guide](https://wasmedge.org/docs/category/wasmedge-plugin-system).
    - A Rust SDK for Wasm programs to access ffmpeg functions in the plugin. Similar to the [WasmEdge OpenCV-mini SDK](https://github.com/second-state/opencvmini)
    - Refactor the mediapipe-rs project to use the ffmpeg plugin instead of compiling ffmpeg to Wasm.
  - We expect the deliverable will cover at least 80% of all ffmpeg functions, and have complete unit test and documentation coverage.
- Recommended Skills:
  - C/C++
  - ffmpeg
  - Rust
  - WebAssembly

### Thanos

#### Implement fan-out query observability in Thanos

- Description:
  In the previous mentorship sessions we added the foundation required for query observability in Thanos's new [promql-engine](https://github.com/thanos-io/promql-engine) and hooked it up in the UI. We now have the foundation to record telemetry from our query engine as well such as time consumed per operator.
  This project aims to expand on this and add more metadata to the query execution, both on the promql-engine operator tree level and Thanos Query `Select()` calls for fan-out query observability.
  Once we have this metadata, we would like to visualize it in the Query UI.
- Expected Outcome:
  The end goal is to have a query execution tree decorated with the metadata, collected during execution (ideally even visualized in the Thanos UI). This will help users to understand the performance implications of their PromQL queries and the bottlenecks in their Thanos Query setups.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - React.js with TypeScript
  - Git + GitHub
  - Any Prometheus/PromQL/Thanos understanding is a plus

#### Release the distributed query engine in Thanos

- Description:
  The Thanos engine is capable of executing queries in a distributed manner, by pushing down aggregations to other querier nodes. This querying mode is not yet integrated well in the UI and is not exposed to users.
  The goal of this project is to add the needed integrations to the Thanos UI and officially release the feature to end users.
- Expected Outcome:
  The expected outcome of the project is to have a fully integrated distributed querying capability through the Thanos UI.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - React.js with TypeScript
  - Git + GitHub
  - Any Prometheus/PromQL/Thanos understanding is a plus

#### Integrate Openkruise workload with ArgoCD and Helm

- Description: ArgoCD and Helm are popular tools to delivery k8s workload, yet currently only the k8s built-in workload are supported out-of-box for ArgoCD and Helm. OpenKruise provide advanced worklood that resemble with the built-in workload,  users can use OpenKruise workload with ArgoCD and Helm, yet they cannot tell ArgoCD and Helm whether Openkruise workload is ready or not. 
- Expected Outcome:
  - Improve ArgoCD integration by writing custom lua script to tell whether OpenKruise workload is healthy. The lua script can be submited to the Argo-CD repository.
  - Improve Helm intergration by building a job container that can check whether OpenKruise workload is healthy during helm install/upgrade process. 
- Recommended Skills: Lua ,Docker, Kubernetes

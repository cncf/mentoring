## Proposed Project ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Build a Go library and CLI for interacting with OpenBuildService

- Description: Kubernetes is set to start using [OpenBuildService](http://openbuildservice.org) as a platform for building, publishing, and hosting Kubernetes system (Debian and RPM) packages. The current integration with the OpenBuildService platform assumes a lot of manual tasks and depending on `osc` command-line tool written in Python. At SIG Release, we're striving to automate as many tasks as possible. We want to build a library and CLI written in Go for interacting with the OpenBuildService APIs and platform that can be integrated with our existing [release tooling (`krel`)](http://github.com/kubernetes/release).
- Expected Outcome: Library and CLI tool for interacting with OpenBuildService platform via their publicly available APIs. Both library and CLI tool should be properly tested via unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, and properly documented.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, working with APIs

### OpenKruise

#### Integrate Openkruise workload with ArgoCD and Helm

- Description: ArgoCD and Helm are popular tools to delivery k8s workload, yet currently only the k8s built-in workload are supported out-of-box for ArgoCD and Helm. OpenKruise provide advanced worklood that resemble with the built-in workload,  users can use OpenKruise workload with ArgoCD and Helm, yet they cannot tell ArgoCD and Helm whether Openkruise workload is ready or not. 
- Expected Outcome:
  - Improve ArgoCD integration by writing custom lua script to tell whether OpenKruise workload is healthy. The lua script can be submited to the Argo-CD repository.
  - Improve Helm intergration by building a job container that can check whether OpenKruise workload is healthy during helm install/upgrade process. 
- Recommended Skills: Lua ,Docker, Kubernetes

## Proposed Project ideas

### Armada

#### Build a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada

- Description: [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) is a way to bring a Kubernetes front end and allow for your execution environment to be something other than Kubernetes. We want to add a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada so we can allow for a k8 front end integration with Armada.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A provider for virtual-kubelet that allows integration of Armada with Virtual-Kubelet
- Recommend Skills: Go

### Konveyor

#### Extend use-case of detecting deprecated Kubernetes API usage

- Description: [Konveyor](https://www.konveyor.io/) provides a [unified experience](https://github.com/konveyor/enhancements/tree/master/enhancements/unified_experience) of tools to help organizations modernize their applications at scale to Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. We are looking for help on extending a use-case of detecting usage of [deprecated and removed Kubernetes APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/) in applications.  This work will involve determining what API resources have been deprecated or removed in each version of Kubernetes and then building [Analyzer Rules](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) to be contributed to our [Rulesets repository](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets), curation or development of sample applications in Golang, Java, and YAML to aid test scenarios, and documentation to help show a guided walkthrough of this capability.  You can see the beginning of this use-case being addressed with a [sample rule](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/rule-example.yaml#L42-L45) in this [demo of analyzer-lsp](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/tree/main#quick-demo). The development environment is based on Golang and Kubernetes. A minikube instance will work well for local development on Linux or Mac systems.
- Expected Outcome:
  - [Rules](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) contributed to [konveyor/rulesets](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets) to detect usage of deprecated or removed Kubernetes APIs.  Coverage for YAML, Golang, and Java source code, addition of this scenario into the project's automated test suite, and documentation of a guided scenario showing usage of these rules via a curated set of application source code examples.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Basic understanding of interaction with Kubernetes via kubectl
  - Basic software development skills (command line, git)

### LitmusChaos

#### Improve litmusctl UX and codebase and add new functionalities to litmusctl
- Description: [LitmusChaos](https://litmuschaos.io) is an open-source chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes, enabling users to test and improve the resilience of their cloud-native applications. The project focuses on improving litmusctl by enhancing its interactive mode with promptui, and refactoring code to Go interfaces for better unit testing and code quality. Additionally, it aims to replace kubectl with client-go for more efficient Kubernetes operations, resulting in a more user-friendly and reliable command-line tool for chaos engineering and workload management.
- Expected outcome: The expected outcome of the project includes an improved litmusctl tool with a user-friendly promptui-based interactive mode, enhanced code quality through Go interfaces, and a robust test suite. The migration to client-go for Kubernetes operations will ensure better performance and reduced external dependencies, providing users with a reliable and efficient command-line utility for chaos engineering and Kubernetes management tasks.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - Kubernetes (Basic understanding of interaction with Kubernetes via kubectl)

#### Improve Chaoscenter Web and Authentication Server: Add Unit Test Cases, Enhance GQL APIs, Update API Documentation

- Description: [LitmusChaos](https://litmuschaos.io) is an open-source chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes, enabling users to test and improve the resilience of their cloud-native applications. The task is add unit tests for Chaoscenter Web and test cases for the Authentication Server. The GraphQL API documentation will be updated with the latest APIs, while the GraphQL server's APIs and handler functions will be optimized to reduce code duplicacy. Additionally, comprehensive documentation and video tutorials will be created for local development setup, promoting easier onboarding and collaboration.
- Expected outcome: The expected outcome of this issue is an improved Chaoscenter Web and Authentication Server with added unit tests, updated GraphQL API documentation, and optimized APIs and handler functions. The enhancements will result in a more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly chaos engineering platform, promoting better collaboration within the community.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - TypeScript

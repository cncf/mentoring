## Proposed Project ideas

### KubeEdge

#### Add case study center in website

- Description: Now we have had many user cases in the community. However, the KubeEdge website does not have a page to display user cases. Many users lack ways to understand and learn KubeEdge implementation cases., we hope to build a case center to display them, so that more users can consult and learn. 
- Expected Outcome: Add user case study center to display all KubeEdge user cases. Users can upload their own cases. Also users and learners can also manage and view cases by industry tag..
- Recommended Skills: JS , HTML, KubeEdge
- Mentor(s): Shelley Bao (@Shelley-BaoYue, baoyue2@huawei.com), Fisher Xu (@fisherxu, fisherxu1@gmail.com)

#### Support latest version in keink and run demo on keink

- Description: keink(represent for KubeEdge IN kind) is a project for running local KubeEdge clusters using Docker container "nodes", so developers can install a multi-node
  edge cluster in one node. Now we need to support the latest version installation in keink. 
- Expected Outcome: keink can install the latest version of KubeEdge and developers can quickly use keink to run kubeedge, and then develop applications on KubeEdge.
- Recommended Skills: Kubernetes, KubeEdge, Golang

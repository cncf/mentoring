## Program Guidelines

Please see the program-wide guidelines on the [LFX Mentorship website](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship).

### How to apply?

#### Projects

Project maintainers and mentors are requested to submit the ideas below (under the Project Ideas section) section using the [template](/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md).

CNCF will select the projects that will participate in the Community Bridge mentorship round and they will appear on the Community Bridge website after the selection.

#### Mentors

If you are a mentor and your project will be selected to participate in the LFX Mentorship program, you'll have to apply as a mentor on the LFX Mentorship website. Please see the [LFX Mentorship guidelines](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentor-guide) for more details.

#### Mentees

If you are a mentee and your desired project will be selected to participate in the LFX Mentorship program, you'll have to apply as a mentee on the LFX Mentorship website. Please see the [LFX Mentorship guidelines](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-guide) for more details.

Information on the application process is covered at the [LFX Mentorship documentation website](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentees/apply-to-a-project). Please note that once you've applied, your application moves to the pending state until a mentor will pick it up. There is no need to reapply (you'll see an error if you'll try to reapply).

The stipend guides and amounts are listed [here](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-stipends).

##### Eligibility

**Please see the full eligibility criteria in the [LFX Mentorship documentation](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentees)**.

### Mentee selection process

Mentors are responsible for selecting and matching mentees to their projects.

Mentee candidates are required to provide cover letters (Statement of Purpose) while applying, so mentors may review them. In addition, mentors may also interview the candidates to understand their level of qualification before making the final decision.

If you are a mentee, please note that you'll be asked to provide the Statement of Purpose letter after the mentor's selection. Please be patient.

### Stipends

The LFX Mentorship stipend policy is described here - <https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-stipends>.

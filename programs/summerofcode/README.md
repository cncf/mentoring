# CNCF + Summer of Code

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation participates in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC). CNCF is a great place to spend a summer learning, coding, participating, and contributing. We are an exciting open source foundation with a vibrant community of projects, and we look forward to your application and your project ideas!

## Communication

Please reach out to us in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions).
Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the admins a note via soc@cncf.io (please use the public channels for any project-related discussion).

## Current Year

Details about the 2022 program are available [here](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2022.md).

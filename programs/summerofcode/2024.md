### Proposals

#### Falco

##### Upgrading event-generator and automating Falco performance testing

- Description: Falco is a real-time security tool designed to detect abnormal behaviours and security-related runtime events in Linux systems and the cloud. The _event-generator_ is an utility within the Falco ecosystem that helps testing Falco’s detection capabilities. The tool also has benchmark capabilities that represent a building block of the Falco performance testing practices. However, the project received less attention than required in the past few years and would require some care and renovation. This Google Summer of Code project proposes upgrading the _event-generator_ to improve its testing and benchmarking capabilities, its reliability, and its consistency, and developing new Continuous Integration pipelines based on it. The end goal is to evolve the _event-generator_ and make it the standard tool for systematically assessing the correctness and performance of Falco’s threat detection capabilities at every release and development cycle
- Expected Outcome: The project will result in an extended version of the _event-generator_ tool that reliably generates a consistent number of events per second and stresses the most common detection scenarios of Falco. This enhanced utility will be integrated into Falco’s Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, allowing for efficient systematic monitoring of performance regressions while ensuring alignment with past benchmarking results. Eventually, this could originate new performance optimizations in Falco itself. A stretch goal for the mentee would be to become an official maintainer of the _event-generator_ project and/or of other repositories of the Falco ecosystem
- Recommended Skills: Go programming language, familiarity with continuous integration, understanding of performance benchmarking concepts
- Expected project size: Large

#### Jaeger

##### Deployment options for Jaeger v2

- Description: Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform. We are working towards Jaeger v2 that is rearchitected to run on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector framework. There are multiple tracks towards that milestone, one of them is to address the deployment process for the end users. The project involes analysis of the existing solutions, such as Kubernetes Operators for Jaeger-v1 and OpenTelemetry Collector, deciding on the strategy for how to support deployment options for Jaeger-v2, and implementing + documenting them.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Support deploying Jaeger v2 via Kubernetes Operator, Helm chart, and brew.
  - Documentation on the website.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes, scripting, CI/CD
- Expected project size: large (~350 hour projects)

#### Keptn

##### GitHub issue self-assignment bot

- Description: The goal is to create a self-service issue assignment bot for GitHub contributors who are not yet part of the organization but would like to work on issues marked for external handling. The bot should be able to check if the user is part of the organization, examine if the pre-conditions for self-assignment are met (configurable labels or rules about number of issues already assigned/PRs opened), and assign the issue. Additionally, the bot should be able to track the state of the issue by adding/removing specific labels. The bot should be part of the CI and executed as an action on an issue change.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Implement GitHub bot in TypeScript/Golang
  - Bot does not require an external hosting
  - Bot is able to assign GitHub issues to contributors following the pre-defined set of rules
  - Bot is able to track the status of GitHub issues with labels
  - Introduce documentation about how to use and configure the bot
- Recommended Skills: GitHub API, TypeScript/Golang, Webhooks
- Expected project size: Large

#### Kubebuilder

##### New Plugin to Scaffold a Helm Chart for Easier Distribution

- **Description**: [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) is a tool that helps the community develop Native Solutions for Kubernetes. Moreover, the tool is implemented using a [plugin ecosystem](https://book.kubebuilder.io/plugins/plugins), which allows users to opt-in for certain options and features. Recently, there has been a strong demand within the community for a feature that packages the Solution done with Kubebuilder in a Helm Chart, as it is a common method for distributing projects, and many infrastructure solutions like Terraform integrate well with Helm. Therefore, the goal of this project is to create a new plugin, such as; `package-helm.kubebuilder.io/v1beta1`, which will enable users to opt-in for its usage either when they create the project or by modifying it with the Kubebuilder CLI (i.e., `kubebuilder init|edit --plugins=package-helm.kubebuilder.io/v1beta1`). This plugin will be responsible for scaffolding all files required to help users distribute their solution via Helm.
- **Expected Outcome**: An initial beta version of the plugin that scaffolds a Helm Chart to distribute the project.
- **Recommended Skills**: Go, Helm, Kubernetes
- **Expected Project Size**: Large (~350-hour project)
- **Mentor(s)**: For GSoC, it is **required** to have at least 2 mentors, with 1 being the primary mentor.

#### Kubernetes Gateway API

##### Design and develop notification mechanism for ingress2gateway.

- Description: [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is the new generation of Kubernetes Networking APIs. Ingress2gateway is a tool to help users migrate and convert Ingress, and implementation-specific configurations to Gateway API. As we add more conversion logic, and onboard more implementations (essentially Ingress and Gateway controllers like Istio, Kong, etc.), logs become insufficient to report conversion results, warnings and crucial messages regarding the conversion. To improve the tool usability, we need to enable users to know exactly the original resource/s -> new resource/s mapping, PLUS what the tool couldn't convert so they could make the final touches before applying the new resources to the cluster.

  A few of the notification types we'll need to support:
  - Overview of original resources and the equivalent resources to which they have been converted
  - Warnings about partial conversions (partial fields within a resource)
  - Warnings about fields/logics not supported in Gateway API

- Expected Outcome: A new notification mechanism to notify users conversion results, warnings and crucial messages regarding their conversion has been added and is being used across implementations supported by the tool.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes
- Expected project size: medium

#### LitmusChaos

##### Integration of Fuzzing Test Suites for LitmusChaos(ChaosCenter) with OSS-FUZZ

- Description: This task aims to implement comprehensive fuzzing test suites for our GraphQL interface and Authentication server ([ChaosCenter](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/tree/master/chaoscenter)) to identify vulnerabilities and ensure robustness. The process involves developing targeted fuzzing strategies to thoroughly test these components and integrating the tests with [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) for automated fuzzing. This integration should streamline the process of monitoring and addressing potential security issues. The task also includes making the results accessible through the [ClusterFuzz Dashboard](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz) for efficient management and analysis
- Expected Outcome:
  - Comprehensive fuzzing test suites for the GraphQL interface and Authentication server are developed and demonstrate good coverage of the codebase.
  - Successful integration with OSS-FUZZ, ensuring that fuzzing tests are automatically run and their outcomes are reported.
  - All test results, including coverage statistics, vulnerabilities, and crash reports, are visible and manageable through the ClusterFuzz Dashboard.
  - Documentation on how to maintain and extend the fuzzing tests as the project evolves.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Expected project size: Large

#### WasmEdge

##### Implementing Coredump for Post-Mortem Debugging in WebAssembly

- Description: This project, [wasm-coredump](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/blob/main/Coredump.md), aims to enhance the debugging capabilities of WebAssembly by implementing a coredump feature for post-mortem analysis. When WebAssembly encounters a runtime error, it will initiate a process to collect debugging information, including stack frames, local variable values, and a snapshot of the linear memory. This data is saved in a coredump file, which, along with DWARF information, can be analyzed post-mortem to debug the error. The project involves creating or enhancing tools to generate and analyze Wasm coredumps, addressing the unique challenges of WebAssembly's memory model and execution semantics.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A set of new API and tool options to specify the saved coredump files.
  - Implement the coredump inside the WasmEdge components, when a trap is triggered, there should be a whole process to log and save any information defined in the [wasm-coredump](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/blob/main/Coredump.md) spec.
  - The coredump file must be compatible with the current toolchain, including [wasmgdb](https://github.com/xtuc/wasm-coredump/tree/main/bin/wasmgdb) and [wasm-edit](https://github.com/xtuc/wasm-coredump/tree/main/bin/rewriter).
  - Documentation on the coredump format, including how to encode process, module, and instance information.
  - Tutorials, examples, and demonstration of post-mortem debugging using the implemented coredump feature.
- Recommended Skills: WebAssembly, C++, Debugger

##### Enabling LLM fine tuning in the WASI-NN PyTorch plugin

- Description: WasmEdge now offers a PyTorch inference feature through the [WASI-NN](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-wasi-nn) proposal. As LLM (Language Model) is a highly sought-after topic, it has become essential to provide LLM fine-tuning as well. To achieve this, we plan to fine-tune the LLM model and extend the current WASI-NN spec by adding a set of extra APIs. With this plugin, application developers can develop the logic to enhance the model as per their requirements.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Take llama2-7b as the fine-tuning target; the final implementation should handle it correctly.
  - Extend the WASI-NN spec if needed to support the fine-tuning feature.
  - Implement the fine-tuning functions inside WASI-NN PyTorch plugin.
  - Documentation, examples, tutorials, and demonstration are required.
- Recommended Skills: C++, WebAssembly, PyTorch
- Expected project size: Large

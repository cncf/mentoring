## Project Ideas

If you are a project maintainer and are considering mentoring during the GSoC 2026 cycle, please, submit your ideas below using the template.

[Google Summer of Code 2026 Announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/google-summer-of-code-discuss/c/D-aU3nHnGBQ/m/VU7lwF_MBQAJ)  
[Google Summer of Code Timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)

Key GSoC 2026 dates:
* Organizations application period: Monday, Jan 19, to Tuesday, Feb 3, 2026
* CNCF Project proposals submissions recommendation: Wednesday Jan 14, 2026
  **Note**, proposals can still be submitted after this recommended date, but the Mentorship team needs time to evaluate the proposals and package our application. The more proposals we have, the stronger our org application will be.

You can find the project ideas from previous year [here](./2025.md).

> **NOTE:** Please note that GSoC is a program known for its strict deadlines. In addition to responding to your mentee on time, you will be required to submit evaluations on time. Failures to meet the deadlines might affect CNCF's future participation in GSoC.

## Ideas

#### Inspektor Gadget 

##### Security-focused UX Improvements for the Inspektor Gadget kubernetes-sigs/headlamp Plugin

- Description:
 This project improves the user experience of the Inspektor Gadget plugin for Headlamp with a security-first perspective. The work focuses on four areas: (1) improving interactive traffic visualization so operators can understand and investigate cluster communication patterns, (2) adding an ebpftop-style view to monitor resource usage and runtime status of eBPF gadgets (to make observability overhead transparent), (3) improving DNS debugging workflows with security-relevant signals (failed lookups, retry storms, unexpected domains/resolutions), and (4) streamlining installation/onboarding with guided setup, prerequisite checks, and clearer error handling to reduce misconfiguration and unsafe permissioning. 

- Expected Outcome:
  - Improvements to an interactive traffic capture and visualization experience in Headlamp that helps operators understand and investigate cluster communication patterns.
  - Improvements to a resource monitoring dashboard for eBPF programs/gadgets showing real-time and (where feasible) historical CPU/memory metrics to understand observability overhead.
  - Improvements to DNS debugging UX that helps diagnose DNS failures and highlights security-relevant DNS behaviors (failed lookups, retry storms, unexpected domains/resolutions) scoped to relevant workloads/namespaces.
  - Improvements to the Inspektor Gadget installation/onboarding experience with step-by-step guidance, prerequisite checks, actionable error messages, and troubleshooting assistance.
  
- Recommended Skills: 
  TypeScript, React, UX design principles 
  Optional Kubernetes fundamentals, networking concepts, eBPF fundamentals 

- Expected project size: 
  large (~350 hour projects)

### kgateway

##### Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation of Inference Routing Extensions in kgateway

- Description:
kgateway provides inference routing capabilities based on the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension project. This integration enables advanced behaviors such as model-aware routing, serving priority, and customizable load-balancing of self-hosted Generative AI models.

However, there is currently no standardized or reproducible way to evaluate the performance impact of these inference routing extensions.

This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive benchmarking framework to measure the latency, throughput, and resource overhead introduced by inference routing extensions in kgateway. The benchmarks will help maintainers and users understand performance tradeoffs, validate optimizations, and guide future architectural decisions.

- Expected Outcome:
  - A reproducible benchmarking framework for inference routing extensions in kgateway
  - Benchmark scenarios covering:
    - Baseline gateway routing vs inference-enabled routing
    - Different inference extensions and EPP configurations
    - Request/response and streaming inference workloads
  - Collected metrics including:
    - End-to-end latency (p50 / p95 / p99)
    - Throughput
    - CPU and memory overhead
  - Automated benchmark execution (e.g., via CI or documented scripts)
  - Documentation describing benchmark methodology, results interpretation, and best practices

- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Kubernetes
  - Familiarity with gateways or networking concepts
  - Basic understanding of AI inference workloads is a plus

- Expected project size:
  Medium (~175 hour projects)

- Mentor(s):
  - Primary Mentor: Nina Polshakova (@npolshakova, nina.polshakova@solo.io)
  - Secondary Mentor: Daneyon Hansen (@danehans, daneyon.hansen@solo.io)

#### WasmEdge

##### Implement Custom Section Parsing and Branch Hinting proposal

- Description: As discussed in the [WasmEdge January 2026 community meeting](https://youtu.be/MKOHVU1VBzg), some toolchains may want to apply the branch hinting proposal. However, WasmEdge is currently unable to implement it due to the lack of custom section parsing. In this program, we aim to incorporate custom section parsing and branch hinting into the WasmEdge toolchain.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A series of test cases that verify the behavior of the custom section parsing and branch hinting proposal
  - An implementation of these defined features
  - A document discussing the design decisions and how to use them
- Recommended Skills:
  - C++
  - WebAssembly
- Expected project size: large
- Mentor(s): #For GSoC, it is **required** to have at least 2 mentors with 1 being a primary mentor.

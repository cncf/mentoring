## Ideas

#### Inspektor Gadget 

##### Security-focused UX Improvements for the Inspektor Gadget kubernetes-sigs/headlamp Plugin

- Description:
 This project improves the user experience of the Inspektor Gadget plugin for Headlamp with a security-first perspective. The work focuses on four areas: (1) improving interactive traffic visualization so operators can understand and investigate cluster communication patterns, (2) adding an ebpftop-style view to monitor resource usage and runtime status of eBPF gadgets (to make observability overhead transparent), (3) improving DNS debugging workflows with security-relevant signals (failed lookups, retry storms, unexpected domains/resolutions), and (4) streamlining installation/onboarding with guided setup, prerequisite checks, and clearer error handling to reduce misconfiguration and unsafe permissioning. 

- Expected Outcome:
  - Improvements to an interactive traffic capture and visualization experience in Headlamp that helps operators understand and investigate cluster communication patterns.
  - Improvements to a resource monitoring dashboard for eBPF programs/gadgets showing real-time and (where feasible) historical CPU/memory metrics to understand observability overhead.
  - Improvements to DNS debugging UX that helps diagnose DNS failures and highlights security-relevant DNS behaviors (failed lookups, retry storms, unexpected domains/resolutions) scoped to relevant workloads/namespaces.
  - Improvements to the Inspektor Gadget installation/onboarding experience with step-by-step guidance, prerequisite checks, actionable error messages, and troubleshooting assistance.
  
- Recommended Skills: 
  TypeScript, React, UX design principles 
  Optional Kubernetes fundamentals, networking concepts, eBPF fundamentals 

- Expected project size: 
  large (~350 hour projects)

#### Jaeger

##### AI-Powered Trace Analysis: Phase 2 - Self-Service "Skills" Framework

- **Description:** Jaeger is the industry-standard platform for distributed tracing. As microservice architectures grow complex, finding root causes in massive trace data becomes increasingly difficult. While Phase 1 of this initiative established a baseline AI assistant for natural language search, the system currently relies on hard-coded capabilities. This project (Phase 2\) aims to transform the Jaeger AI agent from a static chatbot into an extensible, user-programmable platform. The primary objective is to implement a "Self-Service Skills" framework, architecturally similar to "Claude Code Skills." This will allow end-users to teach the Jaeger AI new debugging workflows (e.g., "Analyze Critical Path" or "Detect N+1 Queries") by simply adding configuration files containing system prompts and logic rules, without needing to recompile the Jaeger binary. The applicant will build this extension within the Jaeger v2 (OpenTelemetry-based) architecture, utilizing **LangChainGo** to orchestrate interactions with Language Models (SLMs/LLMs). This project bridges the gap between generic AI reasoning and domain-specific observability expertise.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - **Skills Engine Implementation:** A robust backend framework in Go that dynamically discovers, validates, and loads user-defined "Skills" (prompts and tool definitions) from configuration.
  - **Smart Analysis Features:** A polished implementation of Natural Language Search and Contextual Trace Explanation that intelligently leverages these loaded skills.
  - **Local-First Support:** Verified compatibility with local model runners (e.g., Ollama, Llama.cpp) to ensure deterministic performance without sending data to public clouds.
  - **UI Integration:** Enhancements to the Jaeger React UI to expose these AI capabilities and visualize the "reasoning steps" taken by the agent.
  - **Documentation:** A complete guide for users on "How to Author Custom AI Skills for Jaeger."
- **Learning Opportunities:**
  - **Agentic AI Architecture:** Learn to design stateful AI agents in Go that utilize "Tool Calling" and "Reasoning Loops" rather than simple text generation.
  - **OpenTelemetry Internals:** Gain deep familiarity with the OpenTelemetry Collector architecture, as Jaeger v2 is built directly on top of it.
  - **Cloud-Native Engineering:** Experience contributing to a graduated CNCF project, including navigating code reviews, writing design docs (RFDs), and adhering to open-source best practices.
  - **Full-Stack Development:** Practical experience bridging a complex Go backend with a modern React frontend.
- **Recommended Skills:**
  - **Languages:** Strong proficiency in **Go (Golang)** is required. Experience with **TypeScript/React** is highly recommended.
  - **AI/LLM:** Familiarity with LLM concepts (Prompt Engineering, RAG, Function Calling) and frameworks like LangChain.
  - **Domain Knowledge:** Basic understanding of distributed systems, observability, or debugging workflows is beneficial.
- **Expected project size:** Large (~350 hour projects)

### kgateway

##### Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation of Inference Routing Extensions in kgateway

- Description: kgateway provides inference routing capabilities based on the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension project. This integration enables advanced behaviors such as model-aware routing, serving priority, and customizable load-balancing of self-hosted Generative AI models.

  However, there is currently no standardized or reproducible way to evaluate the performance impact of these inference routing extensions.

  This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive benchmarking framework to measure the latency, throughput, and resource overhead introduced by inference routing extensions in kgateway. The benchmarks will help maintainers and users understand performance tradeoffs, validate optimizations, and guide future architectural decisions.

- Expected Outcome:
  - A reproducible benchmarking framework for inference routing extensions in kgateway
  - Benchmark scenarios covering:
    - Baseline gateway routing vs inference-enabled routing
    - Different inference extensions and EPP configurations
    - Request/response and streaming inference workloads
  - Collected metrics including:
    - End-to-end latency (p50 / p95 / p99)
    - Throughput
    - CPU and memory overhead
  - Automated benchmark execution (e.g., via CI or documented scripts)
  - Documentation describing benchmark methodology, results interpretation, and best practices

- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Kubernetes
  - Familiarity with gateways or networking concepts
  - Basic understanding of AI inference workloads is a plus

- Expected project size:
  Medium (~175 hour projects)

#### WasmEdge

##### Implement Custom Section Parsing and Branch Hinting proposal

- Description: As discussed in the [WasmEdge January 2026 community meeting](https://youtu.be/MKOHVU1VBzg), some toolchains may want to apply the branch hinting proposal. However, WasmEdge is currently unable to implement it due to the lack of custom section parsing. In this program, we aim to incorporate custom section parsing and branch hinting into the WasmEdge toolchain.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A series of test cases that verify the behavior of the custom section parsing and branch hinting proposal
  - An implementation of these defined features
  - A document discussing the design decisions and how to use them
- Recommended Skills:
  - C++
  - WebAssembly
- Expected project size: large

#### Drasi

##### Reactive Agents with Drasi & Dapr

- Description: Current AI Agents are mostly "passive"—they wait for a user to chat with them. To build "Ambient Agents" that can autonomously monitor and react to the world (e.g., "Wake up when a high-value order is stuck"), developers need to bridge Real-Time Change Detection with Resilient Agent Runtimes.

- This project connects two CNCF ecosystem projects: **Drasi** (Change Detection) and **Dapr Agents** (Agent Framework). The goal is to build a unified Python-based integration layer that allows Dapr Agents to dynamically "sense" their environment. The student will build a "Smart Router" reaction that will allow Drasi to send events to Dapr Pub/Sub as standard CloudEvents, and update the Dapr Agents SDK to make subscribing to these events a one-line code experience. This enables "Scale-to-Zero" architectures where agents only wake up when specific data conditions are met, eliminating inefficient polling or fragile persistent socket connections.

- Expected Outcome:
  - **Drasi Router Reaction (Python):** A configurable microservice that routes Drasi events to Dapr Pub/Sub topics based on dynamic rules and hosts an embedded MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for agents to discover queries at runtime.
  - **Dapr Agents SDK Extensions:** A Python module (`dapr_agents.extensions.drasi`) containing Pydantic models for Drasi events and a `@drasi_trigger` decorator that handles CloudEvent validation and subscription automatically.
  - **Ambient Agent Demo:** A complete end-to-end reference architecture (e.g., a "Proactive Support Agent") that detects critical database changes and trigger a Dapr Agent workflow to resolve them.

- Recommended Skills:
  - Python (Intermediate/Advanced)
  - Kubernetes & Docker (Intermediate)
  - Understanding of Microservices and Pub/Sub

- Expected project size: Large

- Mentor(s):
  - Aman Singh (@amansinghoriginal, amandeepsin@microsoft.com) from Drasi - primary
  - Casper Nielsen (@CasperGN, casper@diagrid.io) from Dapr Agents

## Project Ideas

If you are a project maintainer and consider mentoring during the GSoC 2025 cycle, please, submit your ideas below using the template.

[Google summer of code timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

You can find the project ideas from previous year [here](./2024.md).

> **NOTE:** Please note that GSoC is a program known for its strict deadlines. In addition to responding to your mentee on time, you will be required to submit evaluations on time. Failures to meet the deadlines might affect CNCF's future participation in GSoC.

## Ideas

#### Jaeger

##### Service performance analysis on top of Elasticsearch / OpenSearch data

- Description: [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source, distributed tracing platform designed to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in distributed systems. In its basic deployment it allows collecting tracing data, storing it in a database, and querying & analyzing individual traces in the UI. This workflow is great for deep-diving into individual requests, but it does not answer some higher level questions like "which endpoints in my service are the slowest?" To address those questions Jaeger has a special feature called [SPM (Service Performance Management)](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/2.2/spm/), which allows the user to see the trends of services' and endpoints' performance and to drill down into the outliers. However, this feature requires a more complicated deployment where a special real-time processor is running and extracting metrics from the traces and storing those metrics in a Prometheus-compatible remote storage. Some of the storage backends supported by Jaeger, such as Elasticsearch & OpenSearch, can provide the same aggregate answers directly from the trace data, which can significantly simplify the deployment. This project aims to enable this integration.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Support SPM functionality directly in Elasticsearch / OpenSearch backends by implementing the metrics query API
  - Enhance existing e2e integration tests to continuously test this new capability
- Recommended Skills: Go, basic familiarity with Elasticsearch
- Expected project size: large (~350 hour projects)
- Mentors:

#### Enhancements for FAQ Chatbot for Vitess

Vitess is a distributed database system built on MySQL. Developers often need to search through documentation, Slack
discussions, and GitHub issues to find answers. We are starting a project to implement an AI-powered FAQ chatbot using
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, integrating **vector search** with an **LLM** (such as OpenAI, DeepSeek,
GPT-4, Mistral, Llama 3). The chatbot will be available via a **CLI and Slack bot** for developer support.

In the next phase, which will be implemented in this Summer Of Code (SOC) project, we will be adding more features like:
* Content filtering for chatbot safety and response validation
* Fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy
* Pipelines for refreshing data from new/updated docs
* Caching previous replies to reduce LLM costs
* Rate-limiting
* Better benchmarking for iterative improvements
* User feedback integration to improve relevancy


- Expected Outcome: Improved chatbot that provides accurate Vitess-related answers via CLI and Slack, using indexed documentation and discussions for retrieval.
- Recommended Skills: golang, python, LLM APIs, vector databases

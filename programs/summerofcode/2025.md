## Ideas

#### Jaeger

##### Service performance analysis on top of Elasticsearch / OpenSearch data

- Description: [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source, distributed tracing platform designed to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in distributed systems. In its basic deployment it allows collecting tracing data, storing it in a database, and querying & analyzing individual traces in the UI. This workflow is great for deep-diving into individual requests, but it does not answer some higher level questions like "which endpoints in my service are the slowest?" To address those questions Jaeger has a special feature called [SPM (Service Performance Management)](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/2.2/spm/), which allows the user to see the trends of services' and endpoints' performance and to drill down into the outliers. However, this feature requires a more complicated deployment where a special real-time processor is running and extracting metrics from the traces and storing those metrics in a Prometheus-compatible remote storage. Some of the storage backends supported by Jaeger, such as Elasticsearch & OpenSearch, can provide the same aggregate answers directly from the trace data, which can significantly simplify the deployment. This project aims to enable this integration.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Support SPM functionality directly in Elasticsearch / OpenSearch backends by implementing the metrics query API
  - Enhance existing e2e integration tests to continuously test this new capability
- Recommended Skills: Go, basic familiarity with Elasticsearch
- Expected project size: large (~350 hour projects)

#### ORAS

##### Enhance Java ORAS SDK

- Description: The ORAS project aims to enhance its Java SDK to support a broader range of features from the OCI Distribution spec. This involves implementing missing functionality, improving existing features, and expanding the SDK’s overall capabilities.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Implement missing features from the OCI Distribution and Image Specifications, such as [chunked uploads](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#pushing-blobs) and the [Referrers API](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#endpoints)
  - Improve existing features, robustness and tests to ensure full compatibility with the OCI Distribution and Image Specifications.
  - Enhance documentation and provide more comprehensive examples.
  - Add support for additional authentication methods, including using credentials from docker config.json
- Recommended Skills: java, oci
- Expected project size: medium (~175 hour projects)

#### Vitess

#### Enhancements for FAQ Chatbot for Vitess

Vitess is a distributed database system built on MySQL. Developers often need to search through documentation, Slack
discussions, and GitHub issues to find answers. We are starting a project to implement an AI-powered FAQ chatbot using
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, integrating **vector search** with an **LLM** (such as OpenAI, DeepSeek,
GPT-4, Mistral, Llama 3). The chatbot will be available via a **CLI and Slack bot** for developer support.

In the next phase, which will be implemented in this Summer Of Code (SOC) project, we will be adding more features like:
* Content filtering for chatbot safety and response validation
* Fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy
* Pipelines for refreshing data from new/updated docs
* Caching previous replies to reduce LLM costs
* Rate-limiting
* Better benchmarking for iterative improvements
* User feedback integration to improve relevancy


- Expected Outcome: Improved chatbot that provides accurate Vitess-related answers via CLI and Slack, using indexed documentation and discussions for retrieval.
- Recommended Skills: golang, python, LLM APIs, vector databases
- Expected project size: large (~350 hour projects)

#### WasmEdge

##### Virtual filesystem security for WasmEdge plug-ins with exporting WASI APIs

- Description: The WASI proposal defines the variety of rules to guarantee the virtual filesystem security and isolation when executing WASM binaries. However, besides using WASI directly in WASM, developers can also implement the host functions to access the filesystem in their guest programming language. This will break the sandbox of WebAssembly. In this program, our goal is to export the WASI APIs in WasmEdge, and use the APIs in WasmEdge plug-ins to ensure the filesystem security and WebAssembly isolation.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Export needed WASI APIs in WasmEdge internal to provide the functions of checking and accessing host filesystem.
  - Apply the APIs in some WasmEdge plug-ins which accessing the filesystem, such as WASI-NN.
  - Implement test suites to verify the above behaviors.
- Recommended Skills:
  - C++
  - WebAssembly
- Expected project size: Large (~350 hour projects)

##### Port WasmEdge and the WASI-NN ggml backend to the s390x platform

- Description: WasmEdge provides cross-platform support for amd64 and arm64 for executing AI/LLM applications. We would like to support as many new hardware platforms as possible, so developers and users will no longer need to worry about the actual hardware. All they need to do is develop their AI agent or LLM applications once and deploy their services anywhere. For more information, please check the upstream issue.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Make the WasmEdge toolchain support the s390x platform, including the interpreter and the AOT mode.
  - Ensure the WASI-NN ggml plugin can execute without any issues on the s390x platform.
  - Implement test suites to verify the above behaviors.
  - Write a document discussing the compilation, installation, execution, and verification of the work.
- Recommended Skills:
  - C++
  - s390x
  - LLVM
- Expected project size: Large (~350 hour projects)

##### Use Runwasi with WasmEdge runtime to test multiple WASM apps as cloud services

- Description: With WasmEdge serving as one of Runwasi’s standard runtimes, and as our C++-implemented library continues to evolve, we also need a verification process integrated into Runwasi to streamline and validate the stability of both container and cloud environments.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A concise GitHub workflow demonstrates Runwasi end-to-end testing on Kubernetes.
    - Need to design an interactive application scenario that supports multiple nodes
    - Try to incorporate the use of the WasmEdge plugin into this scenario
  - Document
- Recommended Skills:
  - Rust
  - C++
  - GDB
  - git / github workflow
  - shell script

#### Harbor

##### Enhance Harbor Satellite for Artifact Replication from Remote Registry to Edge

- Description: The Harbor Satellite project aims to enable decentralized artifact replication in edge computing environments. This project currently focuses on [Use Case #1](https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-satellite/blob/main/docs/images/satellite_use_case_1.svg), where Harbor Satellite will pull images from a central Harbor registry and store them in a local OCI-compliant registry for use by edge devices. The solution is designed for environments with limited or intermittent internet connectivity, ensuring continuous access to required artifacts by local edge devices even when connectivity is unavailable.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Enhance Harbor Satellite to enable reliable artifact replication from a central Harbor registry to a local OCI-compliant registry at the edge.
  - Implement secure synchronization between central and local registries, especially in air-gapped environments.
  - Optimize configuration management for edge container runtimes to pull images from the local registry.

#### Jaeger

##### Service performance analysis on top of Elasticsearch / OpenSearch data

- Description: [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source, distributed tracing platform designed to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in distributed systems. In its basic deployment it allows collecting tracing data, storing it in a database, and querying & analyzing individual traces in the UI. This workflow is great for deep-diving into individual requests, but it does not answer some higher level questions like "which endpoints in my service are the slowest?" To address those questions Jaeger has a special feature called [SPM (Service Performance Management)](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/2.2/spm/), which allows the user to see the trends of services' and endpoints' performance and to drill down into the outliers. However, this feature requires a more complicated deployment where a special real-time processor is running and extracting metrics from the traces and storing those metrics in a Prometheus-compatible remote storage. Some of the storage backends supported by Jaeger, such as Elasticsearch & OpenSearch, can provide the same aggregate answers directly from the trace data, which can significantly simplify the deployment. This project aims to enable this integration.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Support SPM functionality directly in Elasticsearch / OpenSearch backends by implementing the metrics query API
  - Enhance existing e2e integration tests to continuously test this new capability
- Recommended Skills: Go, basic familiarity with Elasticsearch
- Expected project size: large (~350 hour projects)

#### Kubewarden

##### Allow policies to be written using JavaScript

- Description: Kubewarden is a Policy Engine powered by WebAssembly policies
  that enforces security and compliance in Kubernetes clusters. Its policies can
  be written in CEL, Rego (OPA & Gatekeeper flavours), Rust, Go, YAML, and
  others.

  Kubewarden does not have a JavaScript SDK yet. Recent work done inside of the Bytecode Alliance made possible to compile Javascript code into WebAssembly . This means
  It's now possible to create such a SDK. This task consists
  on writing a JavaScript SDK that provides an idiomatic way to write Kubewarden policies.

- Expected Outcome: A new JavaScript SDK is created. The SDK API is documented, and the policy tutorial as well.
- Recommended Skills: JavaScript, Kubernetes.

##### Elevate our .NET SDK into a first class citizen

- Description: Kubewarden is a Policy Engine powered by WebAssembly policies
  that enforces security and compliance in Kubernetes clusters. Its policies can
  be written in CEL, Rego (OPA & Gatekeeper flavours), Rust, Go, YAML, and
  others.

  Kubewarden has a .NET SDK that allows policy authors to write policies in C#.
  Starting with .NET 8, a big chunk of the work from
  https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-wasi-sdk made its way upstream. This means
  it's a good time to revisit Kubewarden's .NET SDK for policies. This task consists
  on bringing our .NET SDK up to standard with the rest of our SDKs such as the
  [Go](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-go) or
  [Rust](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-rust) ones.

- Expected Outcome: Our .NET SDK has been ported to .NET 9, and supports the
  same capabilities as our other SDKs. The SDK API is documented, and the policy tutorial
  as well.
- Recommended Skills: C#, .NET, Kubernetes.

#### Open Cluster Management

##### Privacy-preserving and efficient AI model training across multi-cluster

- Description: Open Cluster Management (OCM) streamlines multi-cluster workload management through APIs that align with SIG-Multicluster standards. Beyond traditional workload orchestration, OCM enables scalable AI training and inference across distributed environments.

  As machine learning (ML) expands across clusters, data privacy becomes a critical concern. ML models rely on vast datasets, making it essential to safeguard sensitive information across clusters without compromising model performance.

  This project integrates Federated Learning (FL) into OCM, enabling privacy-preserving, collaborative model training without transferring raw data between clusters. Instead, training occurs locally where the data resides, ensuring compliance, enhancing efficiency, and reducing bandwidth and storage costs.

  By leveraging OCM's Placement, ManifestWork, and other APIs. we standardize FL workflows and seamlessly integrate frameworks like Flower and OpenFL through a unified interface. This approach harnesses OCM's capabilities to deliver scalable, cost-efficient, and privacy-preserving AI solutions in multi-cluster environments.

- Expected Outcome:
  - Comprehensive Documentation:
    - Define the scenarios addressed by the prototype, highlighting its purpose and value.  
    - Provide an intuitive and architectural comparison between **Federated Learning (FL)** and **OCM**, mapping FL terminology to OCM APIs to showcase OCM’s native support for FL.  
    - Illustrate the complete **Federated Learning workflow** within **Open Cluster Management**.  
  - Extended Prototype (or CRD) Support:
    - Enable model aggregation persistence in **AWS S3** (currently supports only **native PVC**).  
    - Extend compatibility to support additional **Federated Learning frameworks** like [OpenFL](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl) (currently supports **Flower**). This requires understanding how **OpenFL** works, containerizing it, and integrating it into the prototype.

- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Federated Learning, Open Cluster Management, Scheduling

#### WasmEdge

##### Virtual filesystem security for WasmEdge plug-ins with exporting WASI APIs

- Description: The WASI proposal defines the variety of rules to guarantee the virtual filesystem security and isolation when executing WASM binaries. However, besides using WASI directly in WASM, developers can also implement the host functions to access the filesystem in their guest programming language. This will break the sandbox of WebAssembly. In this program, our goal is to export the WASI APIs in WasmEdge, and use the APIs in WasmEdge plug-ins to ensure the filesystem security and WebAssembly isolation.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Export needed WASI APIs in WasmEdge internal to provide the functions of checking and accessing host filesystem.
  - Apply the APIs in some WasmEdge plug-ins which accessing the filesystem, such as WASI-NN.

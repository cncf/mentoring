# 2017

CNCF particpated as a mentoring organisation for [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/6018829461225472/).

The list of official project ideas for GSoC 2017 are listed below.

## Project Ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Improve ThirdPartyResources

* Description: ThirdPartyResources were added some time ago, but the implementation has languished with multiple outstanding capabilities that are missing. They did not complete the list of requirements for graduating to beta (kubernetes/kubernetes#22768).
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Stefan Schimanski (@sttts)
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/95

#### Code metrics infrastructure, measure, report in CI

* Description: The Kubernetes code base grows every day. Reviews mostly concentrate on functionality and architecture, less on code hygiene like test coverage, cyclomatic complexity, linting etc. The goal of this project is to find better ways to support developers and reviewers by making these metrics more visible on new pull-requests. Ideas are to extend our github bots to post a green-yellow-red traffic light for certain measurements or to add new merge gates e.g. if test coverage goes down without being acknowledged by reviewers. 
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Stefan Schimanski (@sttts)
* Issue:

#### Prototype ssh based replacement for kubctl-exec

* Description: Kubectl exec is implemented with a proprietary protocol. The communication is not end-to-end encrypted. This project is about prototyping the integration of an on-demand SSH server in the kubelet and tunneling of the connection through the apiserver.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Stefan Schimanski (@sttts)
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/42950

#### Bazel rules for generated code

* Description: Bazel is Google's internal build tool with more than a decade of history internally, recently OpenSource'ed. It is well suited for big code bases and complex build dependency graphs. Today Kubernetes uses a large GNU make based build system mixed with a lot of bash scripting, which is slow, error prone and more and more unmaintainable. Early work has been done already to compile Kubernetes and to run tests with Bazel. A big next step is to integrate the various code generators that are heavily used in Kubernetes. The goal is better maintainability and much faster turn around cycles for developers and our CI infrastructure.
* Recommended Skills: golang, interest in build systems, able to read existing Makefiles and bash code
* Mentor(s): Stefan Schimanski (@sttts)
* Issue:

#### Create and implement a Data Model to standardize Kubernetes logs

* Description: To perform operations in large kubernetes clusters, where microservices-based applications can be composed of a considerable number of pods, well-structured logs are required. A Data Model that can help find the right field in the right log and tag it (i.e. app name) is required. This way the logs can be easily processed, correlated and queried so the troubleshooting becomes much easier and the time to find root causes for problems gets dramatically reduced. An example implementation can be done with Fluentd ElasticSearch and Kibana
* Recommended Skills: knowledge on Kubernetes internals, basic Ruby coding skills, knowledge on JSON / YAML
* Mentor(s): Peter Portante, Tushar Katarki, Miguel PÃ©rez Colino (backup)
* Issue:

#### Develop a set of Jupyter Notebooks for the Python Client

* Description: The Kubernetes python client  is currently in incubation. Jupyter is the new interactive python interface, it has a web accessible UI and several key features to discovery Python modules as well as interact directly with a shell. In this project, the student will learn the Kubernetes API by using the Python client and develop a set of Notebooks that highlight the Kubernetes primitives. These will all be interactive notebooks that can be run as a Kubernetes applications.
* Recommended Skills: Python
* Mentor(s): Sebastien Goasguen
* Issue: [https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/issues/127](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/issues/127)

#### Improve kompose support for docker bundles

* Description: Kompose is a Kubernetes incubator project that translates docker-compose application description into a set of Kubernetes manifests. As docker-compose evolves and new versions are avaialable, kompose needs to keep up. In this project, the student will learn the docker bundle format, evaluate its current use and development state, then improve the kompose bundle support. The student will also participate in the support of docker-compose v3 format.
* Recommended Skills: Golang
* Mentor(s): Sebastien Goasguen
* Issue: [https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kompose/issues/390](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kompose/issues/390)

#### Develop advanced Charts for Helm

* Description:  Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. Application packaged by Helm are called Charts, there are currently over 50 charts in the repository. This project aims at learning Helm and Charts and contributing to Charts development. The student will focus on advanced applications pipelines that use multiple charts as dependencies.
* Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Bash
* Mentor(s): Sebastien Goasguen
* Issue: [https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/issues/694](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/issues/694)

### OpenTracing

[OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) is an open standard for distributed tracing. A trace tells the story of a transaction or workflow as it propagates through a (potentially distributed) system. OpenTracing makes it easy for developers to add (or switch) tracing implementations, by offering a vendor-neutral APIs that popular platforms can bind to.

With v1.0 of OpenTracing complete, we are now in the process of intrumenting major web frameworks, services, and networking/controlflow libraries. See [Instrumenting Frameworks](http://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/instrumentation/instrumenting-frameworks.html) for more information.

In addition to the following projects, students may choose an equivalent framework, library, or service, provided it is widely used and Open Source.

#### OpenTracing adaptor for AWS X-Ray 
* Description: X-Ray is a distributed tracing service provided by AWS. X-Ray intrumentation does not currently conform to OpenTracing, it provides a similar (but proprietary) API. Make X-Ray vendor-neutral by building an OpenTracing/X-Ray adaptor, so that it can be plugged in to the OpenTracing ecosystem.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Ben Sigelman (@bensigelman)

#### OpenTracing Instrumentation for Nginx, HAProxy, or other Load Balancers
* Description: Load Balancers and Gateways provide a variety of important services, and are present in almost every distributed system. Instrumentation at this layer is often the best first step towards tracing an entire system. Add intrumentation to Nginx, HAProxy, or equilvant gateway service via an OpenTracing plugin. See [Envoy](https://lyft.github.io/envoy/docs/intro/arch_overview/tracing.html) as an example.
* Recommended Skills: C++, nginx 
* Mentor(s): Paul Draper (@pauldraper)

#### Add "net/rpc" and "database/sql" support for Golang
* Description: Instrumented wrappers for the io functionality in Golang's stdlib, such as net/rpc and database/sql, is critical. So far, only net/http has been instrumented. 
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Paul Draper (@pauldraper)
* Issue: https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/go-stdlib/issues/8

#### go-restful + OpenTracing
* Description: Instrument go-restful (https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful), a wildly used Golang REST web services framework, with OpenTracing.
* Recommended Skills: golang
* Mentor(s): Wu Sheng (@wu-sheng)

### CRI - Container Runtime Interface

[CRI](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes.html) is one of the key features of Kubernetes. It is designed to decouple container runtime (e.g. [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker)) from kubelet by defining a imperative interface for runtimes to follow. Less overhead, less effort and cleaner code base for users to integrate container runtimes into Kubernetes.

#### CRI + Frakti + Unikernels

The goal of this task is to integrate Unikernels as Kubernetes runtime by using Frakti project.

[Frakti](https://github.com/kubernetes/frakti) is an official Kubernetes sub-project which is a well-designed CRI implementation for hypervisor-based runtimes. It now support hypervisor container as well as mixed container runtimes (e.g. Docker + HyperContainer)on same node.

[Unikernels](http://unikernel.org/) are specialised, single-address-space machine images constructed by using library operating systems. You can consider it as a virtual machine but only has a special OS compiled with your applications binaries. Unikernels are considered as the future infrastructure of [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and cloud system.

* Develop a build-in `unikshim` for Frakti to manage Unikernels workloads to serve Kubernetes. Hypervisor manager like libvirt (or QEMU, or even KVM) need to be installed to manage those Unikernels machines and the `unikshim` will be able to communicate with this manager to control the lifecycle of those workloads.
* Required skills: Golang, Operating System knowledge.
* Mentors: [Pengfei Ni](http://github.com/feiskyer), [Harry Zhang](https://github.com/resouer).
* Issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/frakti/issues/99

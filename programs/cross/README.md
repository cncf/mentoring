# CROSS Research Experience Program

The CROSS Research Experiences program provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to CROSS incubator projects. The goal of the program is to seed contributor communities and community infrastructures of existing incubator projects while teaching incubator fellows to effectively lead and delegate.

CNCF is participating in the CROSS program in 2021 for the first time.

# KubeCon Mentorship Session Proposal

**Title:** Empowering the Next Generation: Success Stories and Best Practices from CNCF Mentorship Programs

## Description
This session will showcase the impact of CNCF mentorship programs (LFX, GSoC) through success stories from mentees and mentors. We will discuss best practices for fostering a supportive mentorship environment and provide insights into how these programs bridge the gap between learning and contributing to the cloud native ecosystem.

## Abstract
The CNCF Mentorship programs have been instrumental in onboarding new contributors to the cloud native ecosystem.

- **Success Stories:** Real-world examples of impactful contributions made by mentees.
- **Best Practices:** Strategies for effective mentorship, communication, and project planning.
- **Career Growth:** How mentorship programs accelerate career development in open source.
- **Future of Mentorship:** Ideas for improving and expanding the mentorship experience.

## Target Audience

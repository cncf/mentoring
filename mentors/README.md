# Introduction

CNCF participates in and organizes a variety of mentoring programs. CNCF is a great place to spend time learning, coding, documenting, participating, and contributing. We look forward to your application and your project ideas!

In this guide, we would like to share some information about why you should be a mentor, how to become a mentor, and what to expect as a mentor. We also provide some resources to help you get started and make the most of your mentoring experience.

## Why become a mentor?

Mentoring is a great way to give back to the community and help others learn. Furthermore, it is also a great way to learn new skills and improve your own knowledge. Mentoring is a rewarding experience that can help you grow as a person and as a professional.

It is also a good way to recruit new contributors to your project and community and improve them.

## Expectations from Mentors

Mentors are expected to:
- Come up with project ideas for potential mentees, before the program starts
- Evaluate mentees and proposals submitted by mentees for acceptance into the program
- Be available to answer questions and provide guidance to mentees
- Help mentees get involved in the community, including code reviews, documentation, and other contributions
- Help mentees learn some soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, time management and community mechanics
- Provide feedback on the mentee's work

All the mentorship programs CNCF participates in or organizes are full time mentorship programs. While the mentees are expected to spend 30-40 hours per week on the programs, mentors are expected to spend 3-6 hours per week per mentee. This includes time spent on project ideas, reviewing proposals, answering questions, and providing feedback. Please note that not every project/mentee/mentor is the same, and the time commitment may vary. Teaming up with other mentors can help share the time commitment.

In general, anyone can become a mentor. However, we require that you have good experience with the project you are mentoring for. You should also be familiar with the community and the community processes. You should be able to answer questions and provide guidance to the mentees.

## Non-duties of Mentors

Following are not within the scope of the mentor's duties:
- Do the work for the mentees
- Be available 24/7
- Find a job for the mentees
- Push mentees to do the project tasks

## How to become a mentor?

Short answer: come up with a project idea that is suitable for a mentorship and inform the CNCF mentoring group by sending a PR!

Long answer:
1. Watch out for the announcements: CNCF mentoring programs are announced on CNCF Twitter ([@CloudNativeFdn](https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn)), and CNCF Slack ([#mentoring](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CGPK98JNQ)). You can also watch the [announcements](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions/categories/announcements) on CNCF mentoring repository.
2. Find a project idea: Either come up with a new mentorship project idea, or find an existing mentorship project idea that you would like to mentor for. Definition of what is a good project idea varies from program to program. For example, while LFX Mentorship project ideas are more focused on coding, Google Season of Docs project ideas are more focused on documentation.
3. Submit your project idea: Submit your project idea to the [CNCF mentoring repository](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring). You can use the [project idea template](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md). There will be information on how to submit your project idea in the announcement that will be sent for the program.
4. Review mentee profiles and proposals: Once the mentee profiles and proposals are submitted for your project idea, you will be able to review them. Program administrators will provide you with more information on how to review the proposals and the main criteria for acceptance will be your feedback.
5. Mentor the mentees: Once the mentees are accepted into the program, you will be able to start mentoring them! 

The processes may vary from program to program, however you will be informed at every step about what to do and how to do it by the program administrators, including a timeline!

## Best Practices

### Attracting Mentees

In order to attract mentees to your project idea, we recommend the following best practices:
* Make sure you have a good project idea that is suitable for the mentorship program you're targeting to participate in
* Submit your project idea early, to give mentee candidates enough time to learn more about the project and also interact with the community
* Be available to answer questions when candidates ask questions about your project idea

### Reviewing Mentee Applications and Proposals

To make the mentoring experience pleasant for you and for your mentee:
* Do not accept "OK" applications and proposals. Look for enthusiastic candidates and high quality proposals.
* Do not accept more mentees than you can handle. If you are not sure how many mentees you can handle, ask the program administrators.
* Set your expectations right in the project idea. You would want to avoid to be in the situation where you have a mismatch of expectations with your mentee.
* Provide feedback to the candidates and help them improve their proposals. This will help you and your mentee in the long run.

### Mentoring Mentees

To make the most of your mentoring experience, we recommend the following best practices:
* Be available for the mentee! This is the most important thing you can do for your mentee and it will be the most rewarding thing for you.
* Introduce your mentee to the community and help them get familiar with the community processes.
* Encourage your mentee to interact with the community, and not just with you. While you will be the main responsible person for the mentee, a mentee interacting with the community will help you share the load.
* Ask your mentee to submit their work early and often, and also ask them to look for community feedback.
* Look for opportunities to retain the mentee in the community after the program ends. This can be done by helping them find a new project to work on.
* Share your mentoring experience with your community and the wider open source community by writing a blog post together, giving a talk together or preparing a demo together. This will help you and your community to attract more mentees in the future.

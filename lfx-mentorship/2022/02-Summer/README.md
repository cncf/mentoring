## Accepted Projects

### Crossplane

#### Report breaking changes in CustomResourceDefinition schemas for Pull Requests

- Description: As Crossplane ecosystem expands, it's not unusual anymore to have 100s of `CustomResourceDefinition`s in a provider. A big part of this is thanks to code generation tooling we've been building. However, the changes we make with those tools may result in thousands of lines of changes and it's hard to tell whether there is a breaking change in given `CustomResourceDefinition` in those PRs. Today, we're checking manually to see if there is a breaking change and mark the PR as such so that the notice ends up in the release notes. We can have a GH Action that processes diff in `package/crds` folder and report breaking changes in the OpenAPI v3 Schemas of CRDs. It'd comment on the PR and automatically label it with `breaking-change`. This tool would be useful for the whole Kubernetes community that works to extend Kubernetes with `CustomResourceDefinition`s. We should document the variety of ways to pull packages from popular private registries, and also have testing in place to ensure we don't break any of the mechanisms from release to release.

#### Document and add automated testing for pulling packages from private registries

- Description: Crossplane supports pulling packages from private registries through a variety of mechanisms, including [IRSA](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts/), [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity), and [`packagePullSecrets`](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pkg.crossplane.io/Provider/v1@v1.6.3#spec-packagePullSecrets). There are a wide variety of environments in which a user is pulling a private package, which can lead to confusion about which to use, the precedence with which each is invoked, etc. This can lead to issues such as https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/issues/2876, where I suspect that we are resolving to [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#auth-cloud-implicit-go), when we actually want to be using the provided `packagePullSecret`.

### Karmada

#### Cluster Resource modeling

- Description: In the scheduling progress, the `karmada-scheduler` makes decisions as per a bunch of factors, one of the factors is the resource details of the cluster. We don't want to collect and store each node's resources in detail(That's a burden for Karmada to maintain the information), but we want to build a resource model for each cluster.

### Tremor

#### Pluggable logging
- Description:  Tremor is an event processing system that can - among other things - process logs and metrics. Currently, Tremor uses log4rs to handle its own logging. We would like tremor to have a facility to handle its logs through its own pipelines (similar to the pluggable metrics experience). A starting point could be a sink for log4rs, which could then be replaced completely, making log4rs an optional output.
- Recommended Skills: Rust, Testing

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/1218d516-45af-46a3-977b-e5a9de818cec

#### Hygenic error handling and validation for pipelines
- Description: Tremor uses its own language for pluggable user defined functionality. The language interconnects internal operators via the `connect` statement and the `select` statement. Currently, neither `select` nor `connect` verifies that the operator port of the receiving or the sending part is correct ( exists, and is an expected type ) - this can lead to silent or confusing errors. User experience is super important to tremor, so that is a solution state we‚Äôre not happy with. The goal of this mentorship is to add validation and provide targeted hygienic errors to users that are trivial to diagnose and resolve as this will massively improve user experience.

### KubeArmor

#### Supporting KubeArmor on ARM platforms

-   Description: KubeArmor has garnered interests from edge computing platforms (such as LF Edge OpenHorizon) that leverages k8s control plane for workload orchestration. The primary requirement is to support ARM platforms that are prevalent on the edge devices (especially Raspberry PI). KubeArmor leverages eBPF for observability and Linux Security Modules (such as AppArmor) for policy enforcement. One of the challenges is to check if the eBPF primitives such as observing kprobe, kretprobe, tracepoints that are typically available on the x86 platform are also available on the ARM platform and check if the parameter list fulfills the requirement. Post this analysis, the KubeArmor code might have to be changed to accommodate any differences in the eBPF behavior.

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/a91eab39-88b3-4a42-82bf-2bd963772acb

#### Support for OpenShift

-   Description: KubeArmor is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking operation) of containers and nodes (VMs) at the system level.
This project aims to support KubeArmor on OpenShift. The work will include compatibility analysis of KubeArmor on OpenShift, finding limitations (if any), and eventually testing it on OpenShift.

#### Extend kArmor to include KubeArmor configuration

-   Description: KubeArmor is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking operation) of containers and nodes (VMs) at the system level. kArmor is a KubeArmor CLI tool that connects to the kubearmor-relay service to provide command-line telemetry and observability data. 
The project aims to extend KubeArmor CLI-tool kArmor to check KubeArmor configurations in the running environment. This feature will provide various information about KubeArmor like the current running mode (audit or enforcement), the enforcer used by KubeArmor (SELinux or AppArmor or BPF-LSM), whether it's running in systemd mode or on k8s, etc.

### Thanos

#### Implement Unified Endpoint Discovery

Description: Thanos Querier microservice is one of the core component of the Thanos system responsible for asking relevent data stores for metrics, labels, metadata, exemplars, targets, alerts and more and merging their results. One of the key challenges to Querier configuration is telling which endpoints it should talk to and what APIs it should expect. For this we proposed the [Unified Endoint Discovery](https://thanos.io/tip/proposals-accepted/202101-endpoint-discovery.md/) idea, which allows consistency and easy to use configuration across all APIs. This project is meant to continue the implementation of this proposal and make sure it works well for all the edge cases using our e2e testing framework.

### WasmEdge

#### Create a Tokio-like async runtime in WasmEdge

- Description: One of the most important features of WasmEdge is its support for [non-blocking network sockets](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/dev/rust/networking-nonblocking.html). However, the current WasmEdge API for async networking is still cumbersome. Rust developers would prefer to use a Tokio-like async / await API for such tasks. But Tokio is multi-threaded and cannot run correctly in standard single-threaded WebAssembly. Yet, it is possible to [provide a single-threaded Tokio runtime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61763072/is-there-a-way-to-use-tokiomain-with-a-single-threaded-runtime-in-tokio-0-2). Our goal is to create a WebAssembly compatible Tokio scheduler.

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/666271e6-7bdf-4050-a2a2-3adaac5a7c13

#### Provide a wasm-compatible Rust TLS implementation

- Description: The WasmEdge networking socket API provides support for TCP and HTTP connections. But many web services today require HTTPS connections. That means we need to support TLS in WasmEdge. The [Rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) crate is the most popular TLS implementation in Rust. However, Rustls is based on the Ring library, which cannot be compiled into WebAssembly. In WasmEdge, we now [support](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/345) the [wasi-crypto spec](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-crypto). That allows us to compile the [rust-crypto](https://crates.io/crates/crypto) library into WebAssembly and run on WasmEdge. The goal of this project is to create a Rust TLS implementation based on rust-crypto.

#### Support Durable Objects (DO) in WasmEdge

- Description: Durable Objects (DO) are persistent data objects available to applications at runtime. They can be stored in a persistent KV store or a data cache. [DOs are important for stateful serverless functions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/). The [Anna KVS](https://github.com/hydro-project/anna) project developed by UC Berkeley is an autoscaling KVS ideally suited for edge nodes. It is a good match for WasmEdge to support stateful serverless functions on the edge cloud. The goal of this task is to create Rust and JavaScript clients for Anna KVS using the WasmEdge socket API. It allows Rust-based WasmEdge applications to connect to Anna KVS, and store or retrieve DOs in the KVS. _Note_: A new Rust-based version of Anna KVS is going to be released soon. We will likely use the new version for this task. The network socket API for accessing the KVS will remain largely unchanged from the old version.

#### Implement component-model proposal in WasmEdge

- Description: The [component-model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) proposal merges and supersedes the [Module Linking](https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/) and [Interface Types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types) proposals. With this feature, WasmEdge can execute multiple modules wasm with Module Linking and and more flexible types with Interface Type.

### Devfile

#### Add Compose file support in the spec API

- Description: Devfiles are YAML files that define development environment running in the cloud. The main part of a Devfile is the components section and specify the containers required to code, build and test an application. The Devfile can either include those containers defintions or reference external files such as Dockerfiles or Kubernetes manifests. [The Compose file](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md) is a popular format in open source development projects to define runtime environments for testing the application but those cannot be referenced by a Devfile yet. The goal is to update the API specification to allow referencing a Compose file from a Devfile and to implement the support in the Devfile library.
- Expected outcome: Create a PR against https://github.com/devfile/api to update the spec with the support for Compose files and a PR against https://github.com/devfile/libary to implement it using (the use of an external library such as [kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose) is recommended). As a stretch goal, implement Compose file support for the DevWorkspace Kubernetes operator too.
- Expected size of the project: 350h
- Difficulty rating: Medium
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Compose, Kubernetes

#### Add some syntax sugar to speficy the components that are deployed at startup and those that are not

- Description: Devfiles are YAML files that define development environment running in the cloud. The main part of a Devfile is the components section and specify the containers required to code, build and test an application. Some components, such as those to code and build the application, need to be deployed as soon as development environment is provisioned. Others instead are supposed to be started later, usually when a command is triggered by the developer to test the applicaiton she is working on (a database for example). The current definition of the latter type of coponents is complicated and not self explanatory. The goal of this project is to add a new component field to specify if the component should be included at startup or not.
- Expected outcome: Create a PR against https://github.com/devfile/api to update the component spec and a PR against https://github.com/devfile/library to implement it using. As a stretch goal, implement the support for the new field for the DevWorkspace Kubernetes operator too.

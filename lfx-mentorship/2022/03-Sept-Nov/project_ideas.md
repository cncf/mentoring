#### Karmada

##### Enable configurable resource interpreter

- Description: Now Resource Interpreter framework enabled both built-in and customized interpreter, we are going to provide a way for people customize the interpreter by applying a configuration.
- Recommended Skills: golang, k8s, lua

#### Volcano

##### Pick out reasonable victim pods for rescheduling plugin

- Description: Currently, rescheduling is a little rough to evict victim pods without difference. It should distinguish pods
with more consideration such as pod priority, namespace and so on. Your task is to take a full consideration about all the scenarios,
provide a design documentation, implement your idea and give a full test.
- Recommended Skills: golang, Volcano
- Mentor(s): [Thor-wl](https://github.com/Thor-wl)
- Issue: <https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/issues/2425>

##### Implement pod filter chain for rescheduling

- Description: Currently, Volcano will regard all pods as potential victims in rescheduling, which is not so reasonable in some
scenarios. Your task is to implement a pod filter chain to support custom configurations.
- Recommended Skills: golang, Volcano
- Mentor(s): [Thor-wl](https://github.com/Thor-wl)
- Issue: <https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/issues/2428>

##### Avoid hot node in dynamic scheduling based on real workload

- Description: In v1.6.0, Volcano has supported dynamic scheduling based on real workload. However, the scheduler cannot be aware of
hot nodes which may receive too many bound pods. Your task is to design an algorithm to avoid hot nodes and balance node pressure.
- Recommended Skills: golang, Volcano

- Issue: <https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/issues/2426>

##### Integrate Volcano with Ray

- Description: Volcano has supported a lot of mainstream computing platforms such as Spark and TensorFlow. As [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) is
a new and popular computing platform, Volcano should integrate with it.
- Mentor(s): [william-wang](https://github.com/william-wang)
- Issue: <https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/issues/2429>

##### Support hot update daemon log level

- Description: Users have no ways to update log level of Volcano components now, which is difficult to track bugs especially in the production environment. Your
task is to achieve it.

#### Thanos

##### Receive: Support for tenant-specific external labels
- Description: Tenants in Thanos Receivers currently get one external label which indicates their tenant ID. We would like to implement attaching arbitrary external labels to each Thanos Tenant. This functionality is useful for various different use cases, such as improving performance when querying data for tenants which share the same labels.
- Recommended Skills: Golang
- Mentor(s): [Filip Petkovski](https://github.com/fpetkovski), [Saswata Mukherjee](https://github.com/saswatamcode)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/5434

##### Load balancing of API communication in Thanos 
- Description: Thanos uses gRPC for the majority of network communication. It performs fanouts and sharding of different queries to multiple nodes in a distributed system. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the gRPC, a conventional TCP-based load balancer (e.g. K8s Service) is not enough to distribute requests equally to multiple replicas of the same stateless node. As a result, there is a need to figure out the pragmatic way for Thanos users to load balance requests to multiple backends either by gRPC client load balancing or by guides and integration with popular load balancing proxies like nginx, caddy or envoy.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, HTTP, gRPC

### Devfile

#### Add Compose file support in the spec API

- Description: Devfiles are YAML files that define remote development environments. The main part of a Devfile is the `components` section and that's where the containers required to code, build and test an application are specified. The Devfile can either include those containers defintions or reference external files such as Dockerfiles or Kubernetes manifests. [The Compose file](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md) is a popular format in open source development projects to define runtime environments for testing the application but those cannot be referenced by a Devfile yet. The goal is to continue the work that has been started a couple of months ago to allow referencing a Compose file from a Devfile. The expected outcome is to create a PoC written in go that parses a Compose file such as [this one](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) using [kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose) (as a library, not as an executable) and that creates the objects corresponding to the Compose file services in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Compose, Kubernetes

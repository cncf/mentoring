#### Karmada

##### Enable configurable resource interpreter

- Description: Now Resource Interpreter framework enabled both built-in and customized interpreter, we are going to provide a way for people customize the interpreter by applying a configuration.
- Recommended Skills: golang, k8s, lua

#### Thanos

##### Receive: Support for tenant-specific external labels
- Description: Tenants in Thanos Receivers currently get one external label which indicates their tenant ID. We would like to implement attaching arbitrary external labels to each Thanos Tenant. This functionality is useful for various different use cases, such as improving performance when querying data for tenants which share the same labels.
- Recommended Skills: Golang

- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/5434

##### Load balancing of API communication in Thanos 
- Description: Thanos uses gRPC for the majority of network communication. It performs fanouts and sharding of different queries to multiple nodes in a distributed system. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the gRPC, a conventional TCP-based load balancer (e.g. K8s Service) is not enough to distribute requests equally to multiple replicas of the same stateless node. As a result, there is a need to figure out the pragmatic way for Thanos users to load balance requests to multiple backends either by gRPC client load balancing or by guides and integration with popular load balancing proxies like nginx, caddy or envoy.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, HTTP, gRPC

### Devfile

#### Add Compose file support in the spec API

- Description: Devfiles are YAML files that define remote development environments. The main part of a Devfile is the `components` section and that's where the containers required to code, build and test an application are specified. The Devfile can either include those containers defintions or reference external files such as Dockerfiles or Kubernetes manifests. [The Compose file](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md) is a popular format in open source development projects to define runtime environments for testing the application but those cannot be referenced by a Devfile yet. The goal is to continue the work that has been started a couple of months ago to allow referencing a Compose file from a Devfile. The expected outcome is to create a PoC written in go that parses a Compose file such as [this one](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) using [kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose) (as a library, not as an executable) and that creates the objects corresponding to the Compose file services in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Compose, Kubernetes

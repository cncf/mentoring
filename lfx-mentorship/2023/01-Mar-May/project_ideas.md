## Proposed Project ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG)

##### Add telemetry and profiling support

- Description: Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in GCP with Cluster API. With increasing adoption of Cluster API (CAPI) in general and of CAPG we want to improve the supportability of CAPG, especially for production environments. The first part of this is to add telemetry/tracing using OpenTelemetry so that we can understand and visualize the flow of reconciliation within the provider. The next part is to add a **pprof** endpoint that can be optionally enabled to enable operations/support users to collect profiling information from a running instances of CAPG.
- Expected Outcome: This work will enable tracing and profiling of a running instance of CAPG (along with supporting docs) to supports operations/support engineers.
Recommend Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
Mentors(s): Carlos Panato (@cpanato), Richard Case (@richardcase)

### KubeVela

#### Extend the capability of KubeVela by making several useful addons

- Description: KubeVela currently have a variety of addons , including experimental options, that address scenarios such as Continual Delivery and observability. To further enhance the out-of-box functionality for users of KubeVela, we can offer additional useful addons.
- Expected Outcome: 10+ eperimetal addons, clear documentation should be provided for enabling and using these addons, including examples of useful use-cases.
- Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, cueLang

### Vitess

#### Implement a benchmarking and load testing framework for the VReplication module in Vitess
- Description: Vitess is a distributed database system built around MySQL. VReplication is core technology built into Vitess that is used to enable many features like vertical and horizontal sharding, change data capture and materialized views. The project involves designing and implementing a customizable framework that enables us to test different VReplication workflows at scale and to obtain benchmarks that can be used to monitor performance improvements and regression from code changes. The framework will consist of a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) which will be used to define each test case and a driver which will read the DSLs and execute the tests. The DSL will be based on the Hashicorp Configuration Language (https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). The driver will be written in Golang and target AWS using Terraform for provisioning and Ansible for automation. The results and benchmarks will be stored in PlanetScale (https://planetscale.com/) in the existing vitess benchmark database.
- Expected Outcome: The test framework with at least one working test and stored benchmark metrics for a MoveTables workflow.
- Recommended Skills: golang

##### Add complete parsing support for Spatial MySQL functions
- Description: Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. One of the key goals of Vitess is to emulate MySQL behavior even while running multiple MySQL instances so that ORMs and frameworks work seamlessly. Vitess has its own in-built SQL-parser which it uses to understand the query and represent as structs for further processing. As of now, a lot of spatial MySQL functions are not parsed correctly and result in syntax errors. The task of the mentee would be to add parsing support for such functions and features which can be found at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-analysis-functions.html
- Recommended Skills: go, SQL, yacc, compilers and lexers

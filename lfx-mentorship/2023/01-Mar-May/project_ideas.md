### Cloud Native Buildpacks

#### Pack Performance enhancements

- Description: Pack is the reference implementation of a Cloud Native Buildpacks platform used to build application images in multiple organizations. Because all developers want their code to build and deploy as quickly as possible, small speedups in pack can have significant benefits, and slow-downs in pack are undesirable. Today, pack has no benchmark suite that would safe-guard against regressions in execution speed.
- Expected Outcome: The mentee will create a benchmark suite around some critical path sections identified with help from maintainers. The mentee will be supported in applying profiling tools to identify possible speedups, hopefully leading to at least one user-facing performance improvement.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, git, software development.  (Mentee does not need prior experience in profiling or performance tuning)
- Mentor(s): Natalie Arellano (@natalieparellano, narellano@vmware.com); Joe Kimmel (@joe-kimmel-vmw, jkimmel@vmware.com)

### Kubernetes

#### Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG)

##### Add telemetry and profiling support

- Description: Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in GCP with Cluster API. With increasing adoption of Cluster API (CAPI) in general and of CAPG we want to improve the supportability of CAPG, especially for production environments. The first part of this is to add telemetry/tracing using OpenTelemetry so that we can understand and visualize the flow of reconciliation within the provider. The next part is to add a **pprof** endpoint that can be optionally enabled to enable operations/support users to collect profiling information from a running instances of CAPG.
- Expected Outcome: This work will enable tracing and profiling of a running instance of CAPG (along with supporting docs) to supports operations/support engineers.
- Recommend Skills: Golang, Kubernetes

### Vitess

#### Implement a benchmarking and load testing framework for the VReplication module in Vitess
- Description: Vitess is a distributed database system built around MySQL. VReplication is core technology built into Vitess that is used to enable many features like vertical and horizontal sharding, change data capture and materialized views. The project involves designing and implementing a customizable framework that enables us to test different VReplication workflows at scale and to obtain benchmarks that can be used to monitor performance improvements and regression from code changes. The framework will consist of a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) which will be used to define each test case and a driver which will read the DSLs and execute the tests. The DSL will be based on the Hashicorp Configuration Language (https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). The driver will be written in Golang and target AWS using Terraform for provisioning and Ansible for automation. The results and benchmarks will be stored in PlanetScale (https://planetscale.com/) in the existing vitess benchmark database.
- Expected Outcome: The test framework with at least one working test and stored benchmark metrics for a MoveTables workflow.
- Recommended Skills: golang

### Kubewarden

#### Kubewarden SDKs feature parity

- Description:  Kubewarden currently allow policy writers to use 4 different programming languages. Therefore, there are 4 SDKs to be maintained. However, they lack feature parity. In other words, some SDK have feature that have features not available in other SDKs. It's necessary to map what are the features missing between the Go and Rust SDKs and implement some of them. For that, it is necessary to read and understand what is done in the Rust SDK and implement the equivalent in the Go SDK.
- Expected Outcome: Map all the features missing between the Go and Rust SKDs and implement some of the missing features
- Recommended Skills: Rust, Go, Kubernetes
- Mentor(s): José Guilherme Vanz (@jvanz), Victor Cuadrado Juan (@viccuad)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/issues/392


#### Kubewarden policies enhancements

- Description:  Kubewarden has many policies to validate and mutate Kubernetes resources. Therefore, there are many enhancements to be made on them. However, these improvements are still to be made. Thus, it's necessary to fix the open issues in the policies repositories and implement new policies to add more value to the Kubewarden users. 
- Expected Outcome: Fix as many open issues in the Kubewarden policies as possible and create new policies requested by the community
- Recommended Skills: Rust, Go, Kubernetes

### KubeArmor

#### KubeArmor Telemetry Monitoring and Dashboards

- Description: KubeArmor generates a large amount of data through logs and alerts, but interpreting this data can be difficult. To make it easier to understand, it is necessary to parse the telemetry, create meaningful metrics, enable data filtering, and create visualizations such as graphs to display on a dashboard.
- Expected Outcome: Create a telemetry dashboard, write setup documentation and usage guide.
- Recommended Skills: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana), Fluentd, Loki and Grafana
- Mentors: Anurag Kumar (@kranurag7, contact.anurag7@gmail.com), Ankur Kothiwal (@Ankurk99, ankur.kothiwal99@gmail.com), Barun Acharya (@daemon1024, barun1024@gmail.com), Rahul Jadhav (@nyrahul, nyrahul@gmail.com)
- Issue: <https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/issues/836>


#### Adding OpenTelemetry Support

- Description: To integrate KubeArmor with OpenTelemetry, an adapter needs to be created. OpenTelemetry is a standard for telemetry data, including distributed tracing, metrics, and logs, and has an SDK and a collector component that can run on Kubernetes. Applications can directly expose OpenTelemetry data through in-app instrumentation using the OpenTelemetry SDK. The collector can then gather data from multiple applications in a cluster and send it to various backends for storage and visualization, such as Jaeger.
- Expected Outcome: The mentee's task is to develop an OpenTelemetry adapter for KubeArmor that can receive logs, alerts, and telemetry from the kubearmor-relay-service and convert it into the OpenTelemetry format. They are also expected to create documentation and usage guides that describe how to set up and use the adapter, as well as demonstrate the integration with a backend that supports OpenTelemetry.
- Recommended Skills: OpenTelemetry, Go

## Proposed Project ideas

---

#### CNCF Tag Contributor Strategy - ii

##### Mentoring Workspaces - GITHUBUSER.PROJECT.cncf.io (w/ VSCode)

- Description: pair.sharing.io is a mentoring / pair environment used by ii.nz that brings up clusters to co-learn and co-author via tmate+emacs and a live cluster with many features useful to cloud native development. However, while many folks find the ideas useful, it would be good to reach a wider audience by bringing up workspaces w/ VSCode as an alternative to emacs. The request is for a PoC deploying coder.com to CNCF Infrastructure (likely Packet) and bringing over some of the methods of collaboration learned by ii on pair to a wider audience.

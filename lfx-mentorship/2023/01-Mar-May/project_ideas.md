## Proposed Project ideas

### Cilium

#### Website Use Cases pages

- Description: Cilium would like to have use case pages built out on its website to make it easy for people to find the information and relevant content to the problems they are trying to solve with Cilium.
- Expected Outcome: The mentee will read through relevant docs, blogs, case studies, user stories, and labs to understand the use cases which will drive the content for each of the pages being built. The finished product will be a new use cases section on the Cilium website.
- Recommended Skills: Content Writing, Javascript, CSS

### Kubernetes

#### Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG)

##### Add telemetry and profiling support

- Description: Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in GCP with Cluster API. With increasing adoption of Cluster API (CAPI) in general and of CAPG we want to improve the supportability of CAPG, especially for production environments. The first part of this is to add telemetry/tracing using OpenTelemetry so that we can understand and visualize the flow of reconciliation within the provider. The next part is to add a **pprof** endpoint that can be optionally enabled to enable operations/support users to collect profiling information from a running instances of CAPG.
- Expected Outcome: This work will enable tracing and profiling of a running instance of CAPG (along with supporting docs) to supports operations/support engineers.
- Recommend Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentors(s): Carlos Panato (@cpanato), Richard Case (@richardcase)

### KubeVela

#### Extend the capability of KubeVela by making several useful addons

- Description: KubeVela currently have a variety of addons , including experimental options, that address scenarios such as Continual Delivery and observability. To further enhance the out-of-box functionality for users of KubeVela, we can offer additional useful addons.
- Expected Outcome: 10+ eperimetal addons, clear documentation should be provided for enabling and using these addons, including examples of useful use-cases.
- Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, cueLang

### Vitess

#### Implement a benchmarking and load testing framework for the VReplication module in Vitess
- Description: Vitess is a distributed database system built around MySQL. VReplication is core technology built into Vitess that is used to enable many features like vertical and horizontal sharding, change data capture and materialized views. The project involves designing and implementing a customizable framework that enables us to test different VReplication workflows at scale and to obtain benchmarks that can be used to monitor performance improvements and regression from code changes. The framework will consist of a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) which will be used to define each test case and a driver which will read the DSLs and execute the tests. The DSL will be based on the Hashicorp Configuration Language (https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). The driver will be written in Golang and target AWS using Terraform for provisioning and Ansible for automation. The results and benchmarks will be stored in PlanetScale (https://planetscale.com/) in the existing vitess benchmark database.
- Expected Outcome: The test framework with at least one working test and stored benchmark metrics for a MoveTables workflow.
- Recommended Skills: golang
- Mentor: Rohit Nayak (@rohit-nayak-ps, rohit@planetscale.com)

### CNCF Landscape

#### LFX - CNCF Landscape UX UI improvement
- Description: In an effort to better the user experience, the CNCF Landscape is actively seeking ways to improve and enhance its features.
- Expected outcome: The mentee will plan and execute a User Research to validate existing user personas, gain deeper insights into user needs, and perform a detailed heuristic evaluation in order to gain an in-depth understanding of user experiences. With the findings, the mentee will develop an iterative process to ideate, prototype and test 2 to 3 minimal features, with the aim of beginning a chain of continual enhancements and further development.
- Recommended skills: Design Thinking, UX research methodology, Figma and Visual Design.
- Mentors: Andrea Velázquez andrea@buoyant.io, Nate W. @nate-double-u natew@cncf.io, Chris Aniszczyk @caniszczyk caniszczyk@linuxfoundation.org

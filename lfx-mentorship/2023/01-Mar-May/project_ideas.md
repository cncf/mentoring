## Proposed Project ideas

### Cilium

#### Website Use Cases pages

- Description: Cilium would like to have use case pages built out on its website to make it easy for people to find the information and relevant content to the problems they are trying to solve with Cilium.
- Expected Outcome: The mentee will read through relevant docs, blogs, case studies, user stories, and labs to understand the use cases which will drive the content for each of the pages being built. The finished product will be a new use cases section on the Cilium website.
- Recommended Skills: Content Writing, Javascript, CSS

### Cloud Native Buildpacks

#### Pack Performance enhancements

- Description: Pack is the reference implementation of a Cloud Native Buildpacks platform used to build application images in multiple organizations. Because all developers want their code to build and deploy as quickly as possible, small speedups in pack can have significant benefits, and slow-downs in pack are undesirable. Today, pack has no benchmark suite that would safe-guard against regressions in execution speed.
- Expected Outcome: The mentee will create a benchmark suite around some critical path sections identified with help from maintainers. The mentee will be supported in applying profiling tools to identify possible speedups, hopefully leading to at least one user-facing performance improvement.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, git, software development.  (Mentee does not need prior experience in profiling or performance tuning)

### Kubernetes

#### Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG)

##### Add telemetry and profiling support

- Description: Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) enables the creation of Kubernetes clusters in GCP with Cluster API. With increasing adoption of Cluster API (CAPI) in general and of CAPG we want to improve the supportability of CAPG, especially for production environments. The first part of this is to add telemetry/tracing using OpenTelemetry so that we can understand and visualize the flow of reconciliation within the provider. The next part is to add a **pprof** endpoint that can be optionally enabled to enable operations/support users to collect profiling information from a running instances of CAPG.
- Expected Outcome: This work will enable tracing and profiling of a running instance of CAPG (along with supporting docs) to supports operations/support engineers.
- Recommend Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
- Mentors(s): Carlos Panato (@cpanato), Richard Case (@richardcase)

### KubeVela

#### Extend the capability of KubeVela by making several useful addons

- Description: KubeVela currently have a variety of addons , including experimental options, that address scenarios such as Continual Delivery and observability. To further enhance the out-of-box functionality for users of KubeVela, we can offer additional useful addons.
- Expected Outcome: 10+ eperimetal addons, clear documentation should be provided for enabling and using these addons, including examples of useful use-cases.
- Recommended Skills: golang, kubernetes, cueLang
- Mentor(s): Jianbo Sun (@wonderflow, wonderflow.sun@gmail.com), Wong Yike (@wangyikewxgm, wangyike_wyk@163.com) 
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5358

#### Support auto generation of CUE schema and docs from Go struct

- Description: In KubeVela's provider system, we can use our defined Go functions in CUE schema. The Go providers usually have a parameter and return. Fields in Go providers are the same as fields in CUE schema, so it is possible and important to support automatic generation of CUE schemas and documents from Go structs.
- Expected Outcome: Auto-generators of CUE schemas and docs from Go structs, the capabilities should be wrapped in vela cli command.
- Recommended Skills: Go, CUE
- Mentor(s): Fog Dong (@FogDong, wuwuglu19@gmail.com), Da Yin(@Somefive, yd219913@alibaba-inc.com)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/issues/5364

#### Support auto generation of multiple languages SDK from CUE

- Description: In KubeVela, we use CUElang to code the definition. We want to support auto generation of multiple languages SDK from CUE, so that users can use KubeVela in their own language.
- Expected Outcome: Support auto generation of multiple languages SDK from CUE, including Golang, Java, Python, etc. The capabilities should be wrapped in vela cli command.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes, CUE

### Vitess

#### Implement a benchmarking and load testing framework for the VReplication module in Vitess
- Description: Vitess is a distributed database system built around MySQL. VReplication is core technology built into Vitess that is used to enable many features like vertical and horizontal sharding, change data capture and materialized views. The project involves designing and implementing a customizable framework that enables us to test different VReplication workflows at scale and to obtain benchmarks that can be used to monitor performance improvements and regression from code changes. The framework will consist of a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) which will be used to define each test case and a driver which will read the DSLs and execute the tests. The DSL will be based on the Hashicorp Configuration Language (https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). The driver will be written in Golang and target AWS using Terraform for provisioning and Ansible for automation. The results and benchmarks will be stored in PlanetScale (https://planetscale.com/) in the existing vitess benchmark database.
- Expected Outcome: The test framework with at least one working test and stored benchmark metrics for a MoveTables workflow.
- Recommended Skills: golang

### WasmEdge

#### Streaming data processing with WasmEdge

- Description: WasmEdge would like to integrate WasmEdge as an alternative runtime for Fluvio. We would like to create a compile-time feature for the [fluvio-smartengine](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio/tree/master/crates/fluvio-smartengine) crate. Once this feature is turned on, the compiler will choose to embed WasmEdge into the binary build using the [WasmEdge Rust SDK](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/sdk/rust.html).
- Expected Outcome: A complete PR and a demo app that uses WasmEdge to process streaming data using a Tensorflow or Pytorch model
- Recommended Skills: working knowledge of the Rust language and WebAssembly Rust SDK
- Mentor(s): Michael Yuan (@juntao, michael@secondstate.io)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2231

#### A Rust library crate for mediapipe models for WasmEdge NN

- Description: WasmEdge would like to build a Rust library crate that enables easy integration of Mediapipe models in WasmEdge applications. Each Mediapipe model has [a description page](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_detection.html) that describes its input and output tensors. The [models](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/models.html) are available in Tensorflow Lite format, which is supported by the WasmEdge Tensorflow Lite plugin.
- Expected Outcome: We need at least one set of library functions for each model in Mediapipe. Each library function takes in a media object and returns the inference result.
- Recommended Skills: basic knowledge of Rust and experience in working with AI models and image processing.
- Mentor(s): Michael Yuan (@juntao, michael@secondstate.io)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2229

#### Unified WasmEdge tools

- Description: WasmEdge provides two tools in the release assets: `wasmedgec` and `wasmedge`. However, providing multiple tools will make it too complicated to use. That's why we want a simple entry point, `wasmedge`. As its subcommands, all the tools above should be collected into this new tool.
- Expected Outcome: A document to explain the new WasmEdge tools, a test suite covers the implementation details, and implement `wasmedge run` and `wasmedge compile` featues.
- Recommended Skills: C++ programming language, WebAssembly knowledge.
- Mentor(s): Hung-ying Tai (@hydai, hydai@secondstate.io)
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2226


#### WasmEdge C++ SDK

- Description: WasmEdge provides C SDK as the based library and uses this to implement other languages SDK such as Golang, Rust, Java, and Python(developing). We would like to provide C++ SDK in this task.
- Expected Outcome: A document to explain the C++ SDK, a test suite cover the implementation details, and the implementation of WasmEdge Basics and VM sections in the C SDK.
- Recommended Skills: C++ programming language, WebAssembly knowledge.

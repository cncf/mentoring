# Mentees - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## FAQs: New Mentees and Contributors

### **General Questions**

1. *I'm new to Open Source. Where should I start?*

Welcome to the community! 

- Countless links, articles, videos, resources
- First suggested starting point (for those with no experience at all)
- Start contributing immediately, make mistakes and learn 

*(For those with some coding experience)*

If you have some basic experience, check out the [CNCF Contributor page](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/). It has a list of projects that may suit your skillset. 

Looking for issues labeled `good first issue`. You may also want to start with some of the documentation projects (like the website itself). this is often a good place to start when learning about a new project and looking to contribute.

>The Linux Foundation also offers a free [short course for Beginners](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/beginners-guide-open-source-software-development/) which can help you get familiar with the fundamentals of Open Source and started on your contributor journey.

2. *What is 'Contribution'?*

Simply put, contribution is about adding value by giving back. The open source community thrives on the efforts of its millions of members globally to help shape, develop and maintain its systems and infrastructure, one incremental step at a time. 

Whether you're fixing a minor typo in documentation, or your code is helping to create the next game-changing project, every (approved!) action you make towards development is a critical piece of a bigger puzzle. 

Being active in GitHub, meetings, events and blogs or articles are also examples of contribution that show your commitment and consistency, and overall will help both your own journey and the wider community over time. 

>The [CNCF Contributor website](https://contribute.cncf.io) is a great starting point for new contributors. You can also [check out a great article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/03/getting-started-with-contributing-to-open-source/) on how to start your contributing journey.

3. *Can I contribute if I don't have a tech background?*

Absolutely. In addition to the countless code-based efforts available in the open source community, there are also numerous roles and opportunties to contribute that don't require specific technical experience. 

Documentation, community engagement, project management and even blogging about your experiences in the space are all beneficial to the overall growth and sustainability of the community. 

Take some time to explore [relevant articles and resources] that can provide more clarity in different options available to you.

4. *What's the best way to communicate with the community or get support with questions?*

There are various communication channels/platforms the open source community uses to interact (Slack, Discussion Boards etc.); whether providing support, coordinating work or recognising contribution for instance. 

To ensure that any responses to your questions donâ€™t get split across platforms, stick to one channel at a time so answers can be collected in one space and are easier for others to reference  in the future.

>*Example reference(s):* CNCF Slack as a starting-point? 

5. I'm excited about contributing to Open Source with CNCF but overwhelmed by its complexity. How else can I build my understanding?

- OS can be jargon-heavy, getting familiar with the vocab/terminology can be helpful 
- If in doubt, reach out - the community is built upon supportive relationships

# Become a Mentee

Congratulations on choosing to take part in a mentorship program available with the CNCF and some of its valued members. Contributing as a mentee can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience that connects you with a range of experts and development opportunities unique to these programs. 

In addition to providing a high-quality learning experience that can help to kickstart your career, while adding tangible value to one of CNCF's 140+ open source projects; participating in mentorship programs also offer a range of other benefits that help both yourself and the CNCF community:
* **Community:** Your contribution matters! Participating in mentorship programs can help to strengthen the community and its work by fostering innovation and collaboration while improving overall project quality.
* **Network:** Learn and work alongside experts developing some of the most influential open source technologies in the world, as well as other passionate mentees eager to help bring these projects to life. 
* **Recognition:** Many programs offer stipends and other incentives to support your contribution. Amounts can be based on varying factors including your location or specific projects. 

Becoming a mentee in a CNCF mentorship program provides numerous benefits, including access to experienced professionals in the field, opportunities for personal and professional growth, and a supportive network for guidance and feedback. It can also help you to acquire new skills and knowledge, develop a deeper understanding of the industry, and increase your chances of success in your career.


## Mentee Expectations

Participating in a mentorship program can require a lot of time, effort and dedication. In exchange for that commitment, a seasoned mentor offers their valuable time and expertise to aid your learning and development. 

To ensure the experience is positive for everyone involved, there are a few key things you as a mentee can do to maximise your opportunity:

* **Make sure you can devote yourself to the minimum required hours throughout the program.** This can vary between projects, but often you will be expected to invest a significant amount of time on a weekly basis to your work.
To avoid confusion, *be realistic about how much time you can put into the program*, and communicate openly with your mentor to confirm your proposed commitment is also feasible for them.

* **Be open about your skill level.** Applying for opportunities that exceed your level of skill or experience can mean more work, and possibly frustration, for those involved as the program progresses. 
Even if you are selected for a project, it's important to have a transparent and honest conversation with your mentor(s) about the level of difficulty involved. This can help to establish a clear understanding and agreement about your ability to complete set tasks, and ensure you have the necessary resources to succeed. 

*Overall, having a positive experience in any mentorship program will be dependent on good communication, diligence and taking initiative.* Your mentors and the wider community are invested in your success, so being proactive and assuming responsibility for your progress is essential. 

## Support Networks

Having a solid support network provides a safe and productive environment for mentees to seek advice and receive guidance and feedback. It can be critical in navigating challenges and obstacles, building confidence, and feeling encouraged to continue your personal and professional growth.

* **Your relationship with your mentor** will be your most important connection throughout your program. In addition to providing valuable new skills and coaching, mentors can also support your professional networking and overall guidance in your career. Communicating any barriers to your learning or commitments and working together to find solutions can go a long way to developing a good working rapport.
* **Communication channels, groups and forums** such as Slack can be a great way to find solutions to common problems you'll likely encounter on your journey. Some popular options include:

[CNCF Slack channels](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-native/cncf) such as **#mentoring**; where you can engage to share your knowledge to solve specific problems. 
***Important Note:*** *It is not recommended to request general guidance or to express interest in working on issues that might be raised on these channels. Please refer to the '[What is Contribution?](#what-is-contribution)' section in FAQs for the preferred process.*

[CNCF Community Groups and events](https://community.cncf.io/) - Conferences, workshops, and other events such as Meetups bring together individuals from the Cloud Native community to collaborate and share knowledge.

These and other support networks can provide you with opportunities to connect with others in the field, learn from experienced professionals, and gain a deeper understanding of cloud native technologies. 

Mentorship programs can be highly rewarding, yet challenging commitments to undertake. To make the most of your experience and improve your chances of success, be sure to reach out if:
* You're unsure about next steps in your mentorship or its requirements
* You're having doubts about your ability to complete your work
* You're looking for other development opportunties to support your work
* You're struggling to balancing your commitments, especially if they're affecting your health and well-being 

In summary, there are multiple contacts and resources available to guide you, and a supportive network can play a crucial role in the success and fulfillment of your mentorship experience.

## Programs

4. ***Program structure*** 
Consider the program's format, length, and frequency of meetings to determine if it will provide the level of support and structure that you need. This is also important in deciding whether you can balance the time commitment with any existing responsibilities you might have.
5. ***Availability and accessibility*** 
Ensure that the program is accessible and that mentors are available to provide support and guidance. Consider things like location, timezones and potential language barriers which might impact your participation and development.
6. ***Feedback and evaluation:*** 
Look for programs that provide regular feedback and evaluations to help you track your progress and adjust your goals as needed.

As a final note, reach out to program graduates via the channels listed in the **'Support Networks'** section for guidance; or review related blogs, articles or videos to help inform your decision. 

To maximize the benefits of a mentorship program, it is important to choose one that aligns with your personal goals and objectives. Each program has its own unique strengths and benefits, so by applying and learning more about the experience as it progresses, you can ensure that you select the best program for your needs.

# FAQs

#### I’m new to Open Source and CNCF. Where should I start?

Welcome to the community! It would be good to note before diving in, that there is no singular way to become a Contributor. Like most careers, your path will be determined by your unique goals, skills, personality, commitment, and available opportunities over time. 

_Article_: "[Do you want to start contributing to open source and need help figuring out where to begin?](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/getting-started/)"

There are however a few proven areas you can check out to get the ball rolling:

* If you're completely new to Open Source, there are countless blogs, articles, videos and resources that can be located with a simple web search. There are also popular short courses available, such as those offered by [Linux](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-software-development-lfc102/course-introduction/course-information) or [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/open-source-software-development-linux-for-developers?index=product&queryID=54e7a9a4b82d487dd017ff72baabd439&position=2) that will help you to learn the fundamentals quickly.
* Understand that contributions can be either code-based (technical skills required) and non-code (improving documentation, offering feedback), depending on the needs of specific projects.
* **If you have some basic experience**, check out the following for different opportunities:
    * Many sites related to CNCF and its projects, like the [CNCF Contributor page](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/), will have Contributor guides which outline tasks; as well as lists with several actions you can take to begin your contributor journey.
    * [CLOTributor](https://clotributor.dev/) is a searchable database with dozens of tasks from [Cloud Native projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) you can tackle to build your experience.
    This can be a great way to familiarise yourself with various projects before choosing to commit to one offered in a specific mentorship program.
    * Look for issues labeled 'good first issue'. You may also want to start with some of the documentation projects (like the website itself). This is often a good place to start when learning about a new project and looking to contribute.

**Final piece of advice:** The best way to start is contribute immediately; make mistakes and learn from them. This will help you to get familiar with different processes and community members as your work is reviewed, evaluated or approved. 

---

#### What is 'Contribution'?
Simply put, contribution is about adding value by giving back. The open source community thrives on the efforts of its millions of members globally to help shape, develop and maintain its systems and infrastructure, one incremental step at a time.

Whether you're fixing a minor typo in documentation, or your code is helping to create the next game-changing project, every (approved!) action you make towards development is a critical piece of a bigger puzzle.

Being active in GitHub, meetings, events and blogs or articles are also examples of contribution that show your commitment and consistency, and overall will help both your own journey and the wider community over time.

The best way to start contributing is:
* Learn how to use the project, read the docs, try the tutorial/quickstart, and find ways to gain experience using the project and understanding how it works
* Read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* Volunteer to work on an open issue that you know how to fix.
* Attend [meetings or join our Slack channel](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy#communicating-with-us).
* Contribute a bug fix for a problem that is impacting you.

The CNCF Contributor website is a great starting point for new contributors. 

---

#### Can I contribute if I don't have a tech background?

Absolutely. In addition to the countless code-based efforts available in the open source community, there are also numerous roles and opportunties to contribute that don't require specific technical experience.

Documentation, community engagement, project management and even blogging about your experiences in the space are all beneficial to the overall growth and sustainability of the community.

Take some time to explore [relevant articles and resources] that can provide more clarity in different options available to you.

#### What's the best way to communicate with the community or get support with questions?

There are various communication channels/platforms the open source community uses to interact (Slack, Discussion Boards etc.); whether providing support, coordinating work or recognising contribution for instance.

To ensure that any responses to your questions don’t get split across platforms, stick to one channel at a time so answers can be collected in one space and are easier for others to reference in the future.

**I'm excited about contributing to Open Source with CNCF but overwhelmed by its complexity. How else can I build my understanding?**
OS can be jargon-heavy, getting familiar with the vocab/terminology can be helpful

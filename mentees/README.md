**Getting Unstuck:**
If you're overwhelmed by the complexity of open source or CNCF:
- Familiarize yourself with common terminology using the [CNCF Glossary](https://glossary.cncf.io/)
- Start with project documentation and Getting Started guides
- Don't hesitate to ask for clarification - the community values questions and is built on supportive relationships
- Remember that everyone was new once; asking questions helps improve documentation for future contributors that connects you with a range of experts and development opportunities unique to these programs. 

In addition to providing a high-quality learning experience that can help to kickstart your career, while adding tangible value to one of CNCF's 140+ open source projects; participating in mentorship programs also offer a range of other benefits that help both yourself and the CNCF community:
* **Community:** Your contribution matters! Participating in mentorship programs can help to strengthen the community and its work by fostering innovation and collaboration while improving overall project quality.
* **Network:** Learn and work alongside experts developing some of the most influential open source technologies in the world, as well as other passionate mentees eager to help bring these projects to life. 
* **Recognition:** Many programs offer stipends and other incentives to support your contribution. Amounts can be based on varying factors including your location or specific projects. 

Becoming a mentee in a CNCF mentorship program provides numerous benefits, including access to experienced professionals in the field, opportunities for personal and professional growth, and a supportive network for guidance and feedback. It can also help you to acquire new skills and knowledge, develop a deeper understanding of the industry, and increase your chances of success in your career.


## Mentee Expectations

Participating in a mentorship program can require a lot of time, effort and dedication. In exchange for that commitment, a seasoned mentor offers their valuable time and expertise to aid your learning and development. 

To ensure the experience is positive for everyone involved, there are a few key things you as a mentee can do to maximise your opportunity:

* **Make sure you can devote yourself to the minimum required hours throughout the program.** This can vary between projects, but often you will be expected to invest a significant amount of time on a weekly basis to your work.
To avoid confusion, *be realistic about how much time you can put into the program*, and communicate openly with your mentor to confirm your proposed commitment is also feasible for them.

* **Be open about your skill level.** Applying for opportunities that exceed your level of skill or experience can mean more work, and possibly frustration, for those involved as the program progresses. 
Even if you are selected for a project, it's important to have a transparent and honest conversation with your mentor(s) about the level of difficulty involved. This can help to establish a clear understanding and agreement about your ability to complete set tasks, and ensure you have the necessary resources to succeed. 

*Overall, having a positive experience in any mentorship program will be dependent on good communication, diligence and taking initiative.* Your mentors and the wider community are invested in your success, so being proactive and assuming responsibility for your progress is essential. 

## Support Networks

Having a solid support network provides a safe and productive environment for mentees to seek advice and receive guidance and feedback. It can be critical in navigating challenges and obstacles, building confidence, and feeling encouraged to continue your personal and professional growth.

* **Your relationship with your mentor** will be your most important connection throughout your program. In addition to providing valuable new skills and coaching, mentors can also support your professional networking and overall guidance in your career. Communicating any barriers to your learning or commitments and working together to find solutions can go a long way to developing a good working rapport.
* **Communication channels, groups and forums** such as Slack can be a great way to find solutions to common problems you'll likely encounter on your journey. Some popular options include:

[CNCF Slack channels](https://slack.cncf.io) such as **#mentoring**; where you can engage to share your knowledge to solve specific problems.

***Important Note:*** *It is not recommended to request general guidance or to express interest in working on issues that might be raised on these channels. Refer to the '[What is Contribution?](#what-is-contribution)' section in FAQs for the preferred process.*

[CNCF Community Groups and events](https://community.cncf.io/) - Conferences, workshops, and other events such as Meetups bring together individuals from the Cloud Native community to collaborate and share knowledge.

These and other support networks can provide you with opportunities to connect with others in the field, learn from experienced professionals, and gain a deeper understanding of cloud native technologies. 

Mentorship programs can be highly rewarding, yet challenging commitments to undertake. To make the most of your experience and improve your chances of success, be sure to reach out if:
* You're unsure about next steps in your mentorship or its requirements
* You're having doubts about your ability to complete your work
* You're looking for other development opportunties to support your work
* You're struggling to balancing your commitments, especially if they're affecting your health and well-being 

In summary, there are multiple contacts and resources available to guide you, and a supportive network can play a crucial role in the success and fulfillment of your mentorship experience.

## Programs

There are numerous open source mentoring and internship programs available, with each emphasising different criteria such as specific skillsets, demographics, industries and specialisations.

# FAQs

#### I’m new to Open Source and CNCF. Where should I start?

Welcome to the community! It would be good to note before diving in, that there is no singular way to become a Contributor. Like most careers, your path will be determined by your unique goals, skills, personality, commitment, and available opportunities over time. 

_Article_: "[Do you want to start contributing to open source and need help figuring out where to begin?](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/getting-started/)"

There are however a few proven areas you can check out to get the ball rolling:

* If you're completely new to Open Source, there are countless blogs, articles, videos and resources that can be located with a simple web search. There are also popular short courses available, such as those offered by [Linux](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-software-development-lfc102/course-introduction/course-information) or [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/open-source-software-development-linux-for-developers?index=product&queryID=54e7a9a4b82d487dd017ff72baabd439&position=2) that will help you to learn the fundamentals quickly.
* Understand that contributions can be either code-based (technical skills required) and non-code (improving documentation, offering feedback), depending on the needs of specific projects.
* **If you have some basic experience**, check out the following for different opportunities:
    * Many sites related to CNCF and its projects, like the [CNCF Contributor page](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/), will have Contributor guides which outline tasks; as well as lists with several actions you can take to begin your contributor journey.
    * [CLOTributor](https://clotributor.dev/) is a searchable database with dozens of tasks from [Cloud Native projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) you can tackle to build your experience.
    This can be a great way to familiarise yourself with various projects before choosing to commit to one offered in a specific mentorship program.
    * Look for issues labeled 'good first issue'. You may also want to start with some of the documentation projects (like the website itself). This is often a good place to start when learning about a new project and looking to contribute.

**Final piece of advice:** The best way to start is contribute immediately; make mistakes and learn from them. This will help you to get familiar with different processes and community members as your work is reviewed, evaluated or approved. 

---

#### What is 'Contribution'?
Simply put, contribution is about adding value by giving back. The open source community thrives on the efforts of its millions of members globally to help shape, develop and maintain its systems and infrastructure, one incremental step at a time.

Whether you're fixing a minor typo in documentation, or your code is helping to create the next game-changing project, every (approved!) action you make towards development is a critical piece of a bigger puzzle.

Being active in GitHub, meetings, events and blogs or articles are also examples of contribution that show your commitment and consistency, and overall will help both your own journey and the wider community over time.

The best way to start contributing is:
* Learn how to use the project, read the docs, try the tutorial/quickstart, and find ways to gain experience using the project and understanding how it works
* Read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* Volunteer to work on an open issue that you know how to fix.
* Attend [meetings or join our Slack channel](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy#communicating-with-us).
* Contribute a bug fix for a problem that is impacting you.

The CNCF Contributor website is a great starting point for new contributors.

#### I've tried reaching out in Slack communities, but it's confusing/overwhelming/intimidating. How can I better navigate this space?

Slack can be overwhelming at first, but here are some tips to make it more manageable:

**Start Small**
- Join the [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io) and begin with just a few channels like #mentoring and #new-contributors
- Set notifications to "mentions only" to avoid being overwhelmed
- Observe conversations for a few days before jumping in

**Best Practices**
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- Search before asking - your question may already be answered
- Be specific and concise when asking questions
- Share what you've already tried when seeking help
- Be patient - community members are volunteers and may respond when they're available

**Getting Comfortable**
- Start by reacting to messages with emojis - it's a low-pressure way to engage
- Introduce yourself in relevant channels
- Remember that everyone was new once, and the community is generally welcoming

If a channel feels too busy, look for project-specific channels which tend to be smaller and more focused.

#### I've attended meetings, but I don't feel experienced enough to participate. How can I better interact with this aspect of the community?

It's completely normal to feel hesitant about participating in meetings, especially when you're new. Here's how to build confidence:

**Before the Meeting**
- Review the agenda (usually shared in advance)
- Prepare questions or topics you'd like to understand better
- Have the meeting notes or shared document open to follow along

**During the Meeting**
- Start by just listening and observing - this is valuable participation
- Use the chat/Q&A feature to ask questions if you're uncomfortable speaking up
- Take notes on unfamiliar terms or concepts to research later
- Remember that asking for clarification helps others who may have the same question

**Ways to Contribute**
- Volunteer for small tasks like note-taking or updating documentation
- Share your perspective as a newcomer - it's valuable insight
- Follow up after meetings if you think of questions later

**Building Confidence**
- Attend regularly to become familiar with the format and participants
- Connect with other attendees on Slack
- Remember that community meetings are designed to be inclusive and welcoming

Most importantly, your fresh perspective as a newcomer is valuable. Questions that seem "basic" often highlight areas where documentation or onboarding could be improved.

#### Are roles in Open Source typically for teams or individuals?

Open source work encompasses both team collaboration and individual contributions:

**Team-Based Work**
- Most significant features and projects involve team collaboration
- Many organizations have dedicated open source teams
- Mentorship programs often pair mentees with mentor teams
- Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and working groups operate as teams

**Individual Contributions**
- Bug fixes, documentation updates, and small features can be solo work
- Many contributors start as individuals before joining teams
- Freelancers and independent developers often contribute individually

**Hybrid Approach**
- Most successful contributors balance both: working independently on tasks while collaborating with the broader community
- Communication and collaboration skills are essential even for individual contributors
- Code reviews, discussions, and meetings are integral to the open source workflow

Whether you prefer working independently or as part of a team, there's a place for you in open source.

#### What is the best piece of advice for someone starting out?

Here are the most important pieces of advice from successful contributors and mentees:

**1. Start Contributing Today**
Don't wait until you feel "ready" - start with small contributions and learn by doing. Fix typos, improve documentation, or tackle "good first issues."

**2. Be Consistent**
Regular, small contributions are more valuable than sporadic large efforts. Consistency builds relationships, reputation, and skills.

**3. Communicate Openly**
Ask questions, share your progress, and don't be afraid to say "I don't know." The community is here to help, and transparency builds trust.

**4. Focus on Learning, Not Perfection**
Mistakes are learning opportunities. Your code doesn't have to be perfect - that's what code review is for. Embrace feedback as a growth tool.

**5. Build Relationships**
Open source is as much about people as it is about code. Engage with the community, attend meetings, and connect with other contributors. Your network is invaluable.

**6. Choose Projects You Care About**
You'll be more motivated and persistent when working on something that genuinely interests you. Passion is sustainable; obligation is not.

**7. Document Your Journey**
Blog about your experiences, share your learnings, and track your progress. This helps others and showcases your growth to potential employers.

**8. Balance Breadth and Depth**
While it's good to explore different projects initially, eventually focus on becoming deeply knowledgeable in one or two areas rather than superficially involved in many.

**9. Take Care of Yourself**
Avoid burnout by setting boundaries, taking breaks, and maintaining work-life balance. Open source should enhance your life, not consume it.

**10. Pay It Forward**
As you learn and grow, help others who are where you once were. The community thrives on this cycle of mentorship and support.

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. Your journey is unique, and there's no single "right" path to success in open source.

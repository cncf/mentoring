## Programs

There are numerous open source mentoring and internship programs available, with each emphasising different criteria such as specific skillsets, demographics, industries and specialisations. 

Currently, the CNCF concentrates on a limited selection of such programs; featuring a range of projects to encourage interest from a broad pool of talent and backgrounds. 
These are as follows:

**LFX**  
The [Linux Foundation Mentorship program](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentee-guide/introduction), also known as '**LFX**', plays a crucial role in providing mentees, including students and both new and experienced programmers; with structured hands-on learning opportunities in open source software development. 
Through the program, mentees are paired with mentors based on their skills and interests to gain valuable experience by participating in and contributing to open source projects, all while [getting paid for it](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentees).
 
**Google Summer of Code**  
The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to contributors who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. 

**Google Season of Docs**  
[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/organization-application-hints) is the ideal opportunity for aspiring and professional technical writers interested in non-code contribution, providing support for open source projects to improve their documentation. 

**Outreachy**  
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/) has internship projects in both open source and open science, and is aimed at people subject to systemic bias or underrepresented in the technical industry where they are living. Projects may include programming, research, user experience, documentation, graphical design, data science, marketing, user advocacy and event planning.

# FAQs

#### I’m new to Open Source and CNCF. Where should I start?

Welcome to the community! It would be good to note before diving in, that there is no singular way to become a Contributor. Like most careers, your path will be determined by your unique goals, skills, personality, commitment, and available opportunities over time. 

_Article_: "[Do you want to start contributing to open source and need help figuring out where to begin?](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/getting-started/)"

There are however a few proven areas you can check out to get the ball rolling:

* If you're completely new to Open Source, there are countless blogs, articles, videos and resources that can be located with a simple web search. There are also popular short courses available, such as those offered by [Linux](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-software-development-lfc102/course-introduction/course-information) or [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/open-source-software-development-linux-for-developers?index=product&queryID=54e7a9a4b82d487dd017ff72baabd439&position=2) that will help you to learn the fundamentals quickly.
* Understand that contributions can be either code-based (technical skills required) and non-code (improving documentation, offering feedback), depending on the needs of specific projects.
* **If you have some basic experience**, check out the following for different opportunities:
    * Many sites related to CNCF and its projects, like the [CNCF Contributor page](https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/), will have Contributor guides which outline tasks; as well as lists with several actions you can take to begin your contributor journey.
    * [CLOTributor](https://clotributor.dev/) is a searchable database with dozens of tasks from [Cloud Native projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) you can tackle to build your experience.
    This can be a great way to familiarise yourself with various projects before choosing to commit to one offered in a specific mentorship program.
    * Look for issues labeled 'good first issue'. You may also want to start with some of the documentation projects (like the website itself). This is often a good place to start when learning about a new project and looking to contribute.

**Final piece of advice:** The best way to start is contribute immediately; make mistakes and learn from them. This will help you to get familiar with different processes and community members as your work is reviewed, evaluated or approved. 

---

#### What is 'Contribution'?
Simply put, contribution is about adding value by giving back. The open source community thrives on the efforts of its millions of members globally to help shape, develop and maintain its systems and infrastructure, one incremental step at a time.

Whether you're fixing a minor typo in documentation, or your code is helping to create the next game-changing project, every (approved!) action you make towards development is a critical piece of a bigger puzzle.

Being active in GitHub, meetings, events and blogs or articles are also examples of contribution that show your commitment and consistency, and overall will help both your own journey and the wider community over time.

The best way to start contributing is:
* Learn how to use the project, read the docs, try the tutorial/quickstart, and find ways to gain experience using the project and understanding how it works
* Read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* Volunteer to work on an open issue that you know how to fix.
* Attend [meetings or join our Slack channel](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy#communicating-with-us).
* Contribute a bug fix for a problem that is impacting you.

The CNCF Contributor website is a great starting point for new contributors. 

---

Use the time to contribute to projects, engage on Slack, and prepare for the next term. See [programs folder](../programs) for deadlines.

---

#### I've tried reaching out in Slack communities, but it's confusing/overwhelming/intimidating. How can I better navigate this space?

**Start small**: Join [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io), begin with #mentoring and #new-contributors. Set notifications to "mentions only." Observe before engaging.

**Tips**: Use threads, search before asking, be specific, be patient (volunteers across timezones). Start with emoji reactions, then introduce yourself.

**Feeling overwhelmed?** Try project-specific channels—they're smaller and more focused.

---

#### I've attended meetings, but I don't feel experienced enough to participate. How can I better interact with this aspect of the community?

**Before**: Review the agenda, prepare questions.

**During**: Listen and observe (that's valuable!), use chat for questions, take notes. Remember: asking for clarification helps others too.

**Contribute**: Volunteer for small tasks (note-taking, documentation), share your newcomer perspective.

**Build confidence**: Attend regularly, connect with others on Slack. Your fresh perspective highlights areas for improvement!

---

#### Are roles in Open Source typically for teams or individuals?

Both! Bug fixes and documentation can be solo work. Major features involve team collaboration. Most successful contributors balance independent work with community collaboration through code reviews, discussions, and meetings.

---

#### What sort of companies hire for open source roles?

* **Tech companies**: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical, HashiCorp, GitLab, Docker
* **CNCF members**: [800+ organizations](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/)

* **Foundations**: Linux Foundation, CNCF, Apache Software Foundation

**Roles**: Software Engineers, Developer Advocates, Community Managers, Technical Writers, Project Managers, DevOps/SRE, Security Specialists

---

#### What is the scope of income that is possible in the different roles?

Entry-level salaries align with standard software engineer roles in your region. Senior/specialized maintainers at top tech companies earn competitive salaries. Some contributors receive grants or sponsorships (e.g., GitHub Sponsors), though full-time employment is most common.

---

#### What are common skills needed for open source roles?

**Technical**: Go, Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript; Kubernetes, Docker, Git/GitHub, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm)  
**Role-Specific**: Developers (distributed systems), Technical Writers (documentation tools), DevOps/SRE (monitoring, automation), Community Managers (event planning, engagement)  
**Soft Skills**: Communication, collaboration, problem-solving, time management, adaptability, giving/receiving feedback  
**Community**: Open source governance, asynchronous work, inclusive communication

Mentorship programs help you develop both technical and soft skills progressively.

---

#### What is the training pathway, certifications or internships needed for each role?

There's no single pathway. Many learn by doing—reading code, fixing bugs, and studying documentation. [CNCF Certifications](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/) (CKA, CKAD, KCNA) are valued for skill validation. Programs like LFX and GSoC bridge learning and professional employment.

---

#### Are qualifications essential to obtain work?

Formal degrees (like Computer Science) rarely act as strict barriers in open source. Demonstrable skills—GitHub contributions, merged PRs, technical writing—often carry more weight than academic credentials.

---

#### What is the best piece of advice for someone starting out?

Just start. You don't need permission to contribute. Find a small typo, broken link, or missing explanation in docs and fix it. Regular small contributions build reputation and network faster than waiting for one "perfect" feature idea.

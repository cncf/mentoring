### How to apply?

#### Projects
Project maintainers and mentors, are requested to submit the ideas below (under the Project Ideas section) section using the [template](/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md).

CNCF will select the projects that will participate in the Community Bridge
mentorship round and they will appear on the Community Bridge website after the selection.

#### Mentors

If you are a mentor and your project will be selected to participate in the
Community Bridge mentorship program, you'll have to apply as a mentor on the
Community Bridge website. Please see the [Community Bridge
guidelines](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge/communitybridge-mentorship/mentor-guide) for more
details.

#### Mentees

If you are a mentee and your desired project will be selected to participate in the
Community Bridge mentorship program, you'll have to apply as a mentee on the
Community Bridge website. Please see the [Community Bridge
guidelines](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge/communitybridge-mentorship/mentee-guide) for more
details.

Information on the application process is covered at the [Community Bridge
documentation
website](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge/communitybridge-mentorship/mentee-guide/how-to-apply).
Please note that once you've applied, your application moves to the pending
state until a mentor will pick it up. There is no need to reapply (you'll see
an error if you'll try to reapply).

The stipend is $5500 per student/cycle. Please check out the
[guidelines](payments/payment_instructions.md) on how to be paid.

**Please note that you are eligible to participate as a mentee in a single project per-cycle. In total, you may participate in up to two cycles of the Community Bridge Mentorship program.**

### Mentee selection process

Mentors are responsible for selecting and matching mentees to their projects.

Mentee candidates are required to provide cover letters (Statement of Purpose) while applying, so mentors may review them. In addition, mentors may also interview the candidates to understand their level of qualification before making the final decision.

If you are a mentee, please note that you'll be asked to provide the Statement of Purpose letter
after the mentor's selection. Please be patient.

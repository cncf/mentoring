### Agenda


### Notes/Actions
* Project to help map academic progression - TBC, Alexandre and Nate to investigate - ChaoSS community
* https://github.com/chaoss
* https://chaoss.community/
* Also maps project health but from an academic standpoint; contribution lifecycles e.g, menteeship etc.
* Nate managing spreadsheets re LFX etc. due to sensitive information such as payment details
* Need to plan Term 1 for 2023, before CTA at Kubecon; inviting Maintainers to make project suggestions in the corresponding Repo *(26m onwards - video ref)*
* Not explicit that work conducted during mentorships made visible in known repo *(31m)*
* As part of process, should request that project pages should be updated accordingly to reflect changes
* Move/shutdown of #mentoring channel on Slack to address bot update issue - Nate will investigate as CNCF admin. Desire to move community into Github discussions board owing to comms limitations in Slack; preference to have a central space for core comms.
> [name=Nate W.][time=Thu, Oct 13, 2022 9:17 AM] Followup: The bot has been removed.
* Organisational discussions in TAG-CS etc.

---
### **Notes**

**Outreachy** - some interest in Kubernetes etc.; Josh suggested might be of value from someone in the community to support with Outreachy 

* Ideally someone who would reach out to various programs to gauge interest
* May be more 'participant-driven' - Ambassador-type role, help with administration
* Put a call-out on (TAG Contributor Strategy) mailing list and chat channel to encourage a response
* May escalate to TOC list
* Would be good to implement same thing (not yet K8s) - treat short-term internship opps...
* Timing is key between programs (as well as overhead)
* No current plan exists to 'improve' LFX - or to be executed
* Outreachy - up to 3 admins; you don't have to cancel your own admin rights to action that
* Q: *What's the CNCF funding situation for Outreachy?* 
    * (K8s sorted but status of other projects?) - Nate to follow-up; need to know before recruitment call goes out.
    * LFX accepts direct donations, built-in funding mechanism. No compensation for mentors; sometimes for Outreachy - often dependent as to whether mentor is currently in employment etc.
    * Smallest staff-base which may restrict access/availability in certain countries, can also affect payment.
    
* todo: list (or collect lists) countries that we support internships in


**GSoC** - **'Community responsibility'**
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YKEEIGZPlTQtlggtNDEf-_BU718Sr9aQH4WDs1fpL0s/edit?usp=sharing -- slide ~68
https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/tree/main/mentoring

* Detail not currently reflected in Charter: 
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_hpVAKxxNaSgVYAsHdjq_57eZEkYUuxcxecbcl3H9c/edit
    - https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/tree/main/mentoring
* Potentially help in developing Mission Statement etc. 
    "promote growth and sustainability for projects through mentoring new and existing contributors"
    "provide support and advice for the projects"
    
* Open a new PR with proposed changes to the statement - need to bounce to liaisons for final approval.
    * Update to mission statement proposal:
https://github.com/Riaankl/tag-contributor-strategy/compare/main...Update-Mission-statement 
        - https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/pull/236

**Contributor Opportunities board**
* Not a project with a deadline attached
* Past efforts i.e. K8s have failed
* Better to engage with wider community over time to improve chances of success and quality
* Contributor Survey will help to identify focus areas in the meantime
* One of the biggest obstacles is encouraging Maintainers etc. to keep info up-to-date; how can we make it easy for them to do so?
* Building something new immediately implies/requires maintenance

**Mentoring Website**
* Should be a part of Contributor website
* Request help w/ mentoring discussions board - common Q is 'how to get started'? - use for discussion vs. using #mentoring Slack
* 'Getting Started' page would provide value
* Two main constituents are (new) Contributors and Maintainers - 
*Tentative actions:*
    * research what's available in mentoring in repo
    * build out diagram to map/canvas contents
    * figure out what's wanted/needed
    * look at existing Contributor.io infrastructure and determine what should be integrated

* CloudNative.nz site 
* Mentoring info session at ii [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/cloudnative-nz/events/287887918/)

### Agenda

* Revisiting focus
* WG participation/actions
* Supporting messaging/engagement for potential contributors


### Notes

**Optimising Channels**
* Potential split/separation between communication and GitHub app comms/bot; establish a thread
* Separate #'Mentoring Bot' etc. - can the bot be configured accordingly?
* Separate channel for TAG Contributor Strategy - process for infrastructure change? Wait until Nate's back to review.  Probably create #tag-cs-notices, direct all auto traffic to that
> [name=Nate W.]
> [time=Thu, Aug 25, 2022 3:32 PM] I question if we need the github/slack notifications bot at all. I'll look into the historical rationale for it. We have been trying to push towards using https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions instead of slack for comms with mentees/potential mentees.

**Managing Engagement**
* Hippie receiving alot of contact re LFX project including questions, CVs etc. - how to best manage comms
* Possible CRM to manage communications - HubSpot, AirTable etc. - spreadsheet can be difficult to modify later if/when needed. Can adjust later as required
* Steps/processes may be unclear to mentees e.g., project submission, redirection, balancing correspondence.
* Need to review existing LFX systems - consider legalities as mentees are technically short-term 'employees'; 
> [name=Nate W.] 
> [time=Thu, Aug 25, 2022 3:04 PM] Mentees are specifically _not_ employees (https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentees): "NOTE: Mentees are not employed by the Linux Foundation. The Linux Foundation’s employment opportunities are available at https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/careers."  
> I agree we should review and understand what mentee status actually is.
* Recognising two channels w/ mentoring: 
    1. increasing awareness for new/potential contributors 
    1. the need for the WG to be proactive in reaching out to those already in the ecosystem 
* Most projects may not be aware this initiative exists - share success stories as often as possible to help provide clarity; can we create blogs, interviews etc. to do this?

**Strategy & Resource/Knowledge Base**
* Need to create strategy to build a culture and community around mentorship; if people become involved, how can we share positive experiences and develop a 'flow' within community.
* Possible platform to share knowledge - when the program runs there are likely to be similar questions among participants; GitHub etc? Need to decide appropriate platform, learn from past mentorships
    * e.g. Mentorship experience - how to make a PR, mentee/mentor public profiles, Q&As (categorised) - can iterate over time
* **Can Contributor Docs be written in a way that are more beneficial for maintainers**, current documentation doesn't exist; direct mentee/mentor engagement can be more difficult
* Can possibly be implemented together - current lack of building tools from CNCF/LF.
* Support mentors in providing resources for mentees e.g. markdown docs on GitHub, search function i.e. Develop template - see existing Contributor Guide templates
    * Difficulties in explaining e.g. PRs processes, providing clear examples would help alot towards this
    * **The obstacle is getting the guide written in the first place!** e.g. can a question raised in Slack become a bulletpoint in the guide.
* Inventory of existing resources - what are permissions for partnerships, collaboration etc. 
* Not sure of known policies re exclusive permissions - does someone have a knowledge-base app to support
* **Objective is to optimise Mentors' time**; source key info for easy mentee reference 
* Scope for CNCF funding - more for knowledge-base for Sandbox projects, separate for NZ projects

#### Next Actions:
* Follow up w/ Nate: recommended LFX mentee engagement process to clarify mentor communication/interaction
* Map mentee/mentor pathway to identify onboarding journey and areas for focus/improvement 
* Draft strategy doc 
* Stocktake of existing processes, resources, knowledge bases
* List common barriers to new contributors
* Investigate separation of Mentoring channel - general communications from GitHub bot updates

  * https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/google-summer-of-code-discuss/649212c4-fe0d-4cb6-8e48-17f961e3d0ben%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer

- Ali:
Could we have the [Ideas page](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2022.md) open earlier? Motivation for the ask is that the potential mentees want to start exploring the project ideas earlier. Similarly, maintainers want to list their ideas earlier for encouraging a head start.

- Options are making the Ideas page availible through out the year
- Incorporate CLOtributor with the process with `Help wanted` & `Mentor Available` labels
    - AI: Riaan & Jay add CLOTributor to the Mentoring repo
- **Could use Git discussions for this as well.** 
    - GSOC 2022 - Nate opened a thread to support this, however only 15% of this thread was used; also creating alot of overhead to maintain. Because this will all link back to upstream issues; preferred this would occur off the boards. 
    - Might also be hard to filter convos back into the issues themselves as well. An ideas page however would give a centralised reference point for those seeking information. 
    - We should keep encouraging mentees to reach out to potential mentors; aiming to give mentors more time to make their selections as well.
    - Having alot of mentees/applicants can be difficult to filter/process effectively otherwise.
    - Another option might be for mentees to 'source' their own mentors to support/drive projects as well > Application Process
        - If a potential mentee is interested in a CNCF project and wants to do a mentorship, this should put the impetus on the mentee themselves; this mechanism currently exists but is not explicitly communicated.
        - This might be an issue especially for paid mentorships such as LFX. This could be exploited from a faculty of an education provider for instance that could implement their own mentee without following the preferred process.  
**How to incorporate Clotributor into the existing onboarding process?** Future working session(s) to determine best course of action.

**Repo update**
- Thank you for review Ali & Nate
- Next step might be to merge in v2 branch
    - Then clean up and distill information in Mentee and Mentor files to a single readme for people to the contribute
    - Try and make the info clear one stop place to find info
    - Might have to hold back on merging in the v2 branch because links have been publish to current repo info.
    - When would be a good time to remove the WIP label from the PR.
        - Likely after updating Mentee and Mentor sections is in a workable state + FAQs
* Should be rebasing but leave number of commits
* Folder restructure, mentee/mentor page and FAQ
* GitHub doesnt have a redirection tool; maintainters have been notified, potential applicants will seek this information - work can be continued once ideas have been confirmed/agreed upon, possibly next week.
Q. Keep v1 page blank with link to v2 page
Edit page we would link to, highlight page move. Can hold off on this until the last minute; let's keep it clean in the meantime.

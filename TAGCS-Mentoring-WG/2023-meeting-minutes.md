### Agenda

* Adding Ali Ok to GSoC CNCF administration team

* Project Board/Management  
  https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/16/views/1

  
### Notes

* Ali OK accepted as GSOC admin, new process in ongoing review, operations/comms will be conducted in open and continue refinement going forward. 
* LFX Term 1 updates - 20% all mentors have made their selections; may have missed deadline notification prior > 7 March. 
    * Suggested acceptance process starts now to reduce admin processes w/ Nate and LFX. Nate will send an email and post to confirm
* Contacts to go to Natali from previous meeting
* Question about GSoD: https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions/843#discussioncomment-5052374
    * Not yet run as an org (Nate); GSOD issue last year - allowed only one project per year previously. **Reach out to Google and clarify/confirm any project submission limitations.**
    * (Previously one project per OS project)
    * > (b) Each Organization may submit one (1) Organization Application. https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/terms/program-rules
    * Timeline: https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline
* Alexandre experiencing multiple enquiries regarding getting started in Mentoring
    * (Josh) need clarity about target audiences; persona-based responses 
    * Queries generally broad and inconsistent - general 'guidance'-based questions
    * Resources/guides would need to linked to support navigation; conscious of large workload to inform/build fundamental understanding
    * Potential contributors might be cautious of needing 'permission' of getting involved to begin with
    * This would go at: https://contribute.cncf.io/contributors/
    * Maybe a short video can be recorded (can be asked from CNCF Ambassadors)(example) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msyGybzCKRs
    * Potential personas
      * new to open source
      * new to cloud native
      * folks changing careers(?)
        * may not lead to sustained contributions (NW + JB)
        * may be an in to opensource regardless (JT + AN)
        * Ongoing discussion needed; to refer to TAG-CS
        * File an issue, attach to draft doc in HackMD/Google Docs, mention on Slack - pertains to both mentoring and Contributor Growth
      * folks assigned by their company to work on open source
      * AN to open issue: https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy/
        * Previous Slack discussion https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CT6CWS1JN/p1675715555437939
* 65 projects proposed for LFX, no viable candidates for all projects at this stage
* GSOC - March 20 potential contributors to propose, expecting comms in boards re upstream issues

### Notes

**GSOD** 
* Applications starting tomorrow. Would like to apply as an org; requires doc project proposals to support application submission.
* Not expected to have as many slots available this year, but would like to proceed regardless. Nate will create PR to set up GSOD.

**Notification template for Mentees**
* Following thread in TAG-CS Slack - response to lots of 'noise' in #mentoring w/ general questions vs. support of upstream issues.
* Msg replies not necessarily helpful in redirecting or addressing issue. Need to create more effective responses e.g. *template as well as support/training to also foster positive engagement and retention.*
* Need multiple fronts to 'teach' the preferred behaviour; in addition to Ambassadors supporting this, having coordinated responses
* Matter of coaching people out of learned behaviours that might not be constructive to attaining opportunities or impacting future relationships; may be less about *contributing* than not even investigating the project to begin with.
* Better to have template 'available', or respond to every such request/query each time - how to best manage overall 'noise'? e.g. responding to multiple instances than every single one.
* https://hackmd.io/W-VB1zZtTnOJFBSWR3frUA (working doc)

**Timeline proposals for LFX mentorships Term 2-3**
* Open for discussion

Social links boost, need support/please share!
* Deadline is 21/2/23

**V2**
* Current layout/format ineffective in guiding mentees/mentors effectively, as well as structuring/archiving program information. 
* User perspective vs. group view on what's needed in this Repo - to help group determine what needs to be updated first e.g. who will be engaging with this resource.
* Can utilise mentees/mentors to review and provide feedback - previous mentees for could be more beneficial (even limited numbers)
  * TODO: Nate to reach out to find folks, Natali to run interviews
* Could potentially request mentees at program completion review the Repo as well. 
* Need to confirm what is needed to produce an MVP ahead of potential merge in the next month
* Contributions - comment PR-level discussions; link any new PRs against V2 to maintain visibility.
* Umbrella PR: https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/pull/733

**CLOTributor**
* Being positioned as preferred 'job boards' to promote opportunities for contributors; recommended to focus here for development.

  * https://hackmd.io/@tag-cs-mentoring-wg/2023-goals

  * project board: https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/16/views/1
* GSoC Org applications
  * Nate W. to work with Chris A. to apply as an org
  * https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/google-summer-of-code-discuss/649212c4-fe0d-4cb6-8e48-17f961e3d0ben%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer

- Ali:
Could we have the [Ideas page](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2022.md) open earlier? Motivation for the ask is that the potential mentees want to start exploring the project ideas earlier. Similarly, maintainers want to list their ideas earlier for encouraging a head start.

- Options are making the Ideas page availible through out the year
- Incorporate CLOtributor with the process with `Help wanted` & `Mentor Available` labels
    - AI: Riaan & Jay add CLOTributor to the Mentoring repo
- **Could use Git discussions for this as well.** 
    - GSOC 2022 - Nate opened a thread to support this, however only 15% of this thread was used; also creating alot of overhead to maintain. Because this will all link back to upstream issues; preferred this would occur off the boards. 
    - Might also be hard to filter convos back into the issues themselves as well. An ideas page however would give a centralised reference point for those seeking information. 
    - We should keep encouraging mentees to reach out to potential mentors; aiming to give mentors more time to make their selections as well.
    - Having alot of mentees/applicants can be difficult to filter/process effectively otherwise.
    - Another option might be for mentees to 'source' their own mentors to support/drive projects as well > Application Process
        - If a potential mentee is interested in a CNCF project and wants to do a mentorship, this should put the impetus on the mentee themselves; this mechanism currently exists but is not explicitly communicated.
        - This might be an issue especially for paid mentorships such as LFX. This could be exploited from a faculty of an education provider for instance that could implement their own mentee without following the preferred process.  
**How to incorporate Clotributor into the existing onboarding process?** Future working session(s) to determine best course of action.

**Repo update**
- Thank you for review Ali & Nate
- Next step might be to merge in v2 branch
    - Then clean up and distill information in Mentee and Mentor files to a single readme for people to the contribute
    - Try and make the info clear one stop place to find info
    - Might have to hold back on merging in the v2 branch because links have been publish to current repo info.
    - When would be a good time to remove the WIP label from the PR.
        - Likely after updating Mentee and Mentor sections is in a workable state + FAQs
* Should be rebasing but leave number of commits
* Folder restructure, mentee/mentor page and FAQ
* GitHub doesnt have a redirection tool; maintainters have been notified, potential applicants will seek this information - work can be continued once ideas have been confirmed/agreed upon, possibly next week.
Q. Keep v1 page blank with link to v2 page
Edit page we would link to, highlight page move. Can hold off on this until the last minute; let's keep it clean in the meantime.
